<h2>THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE<br />
OF<br />
ROOT CULTIVATION.</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ORIGIN OF ROOT CROPS.</h4>

<p>Few people who have studied the matter attentively
but have arrived at the conclusion that those plants
which we cultivate for their roots were not naturally
endowed with the root portion of their structure
either of the size or form which would now be considered
as essential for a perfect crop plant. Thus the
parsnip, carrot, turnip, beet, &amp;c., as we find them in
nature, have nowhere the large, fleshy, smooth
appearance which belongs to their cultivated forms;
and hence all the varieties of these that we meet with
in cultivation must be considered as <i>derivatives</i> from
original wild forms, obtained by <i>cultivative processes</i>;
that is, collecting their seed, planting it in a prepared
bed, stimulating the growth of the plants with
manures, thinning, regulating, weeding, and such
other acts as constitute farming or gardening, as the
case may be.</p>

<p>Hence, then, it is concluded that such plants as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
grown for their roots have a peculiar aptitude for
laying on tissue, and thus increasing the bulk of their
&#8220;descending axis,&#8221; that is, that portion of their
structure which grows downwards&#8212;root. Besides
this, they are remarkable for their capability of
producing varieties&#8212;a fact which, united with a
constancy in the maintenance of an induced form,
renders it exceedingly easy to bring out new sorts
which will maintain their characteristics under great
diversities of climate, soil, and treatment.</p>

<p>The facility with which different sorts of roots
may be procured can readily be understood from the
many varieties, not only of <i>turnip</i>&#8212;which may
perhaps be considered as an original species&#8212;but also
of swede, which is a hybrid of the turnip and rape
plant. Of the former we have more than thirty sorts
grown by the farmer, and as many peculiar to the
garden; whilst there are probably more than twenty
well-recognized sorts of swedes. Of beets, with
mangel-wurzel, we have almost as great a variety;
so also of carrots. Of parsnips we have fewer varieties,
to which may now be added the new form called
the Student parsnip, the growth of which is so
interesting that we shall here give a short history
of its production, as an illustration of the origin of
root crops.</p>

<p>In 1847 we collected some wild parsnip seed from
the top of the Cotteswolds, where this is among the
most frequent of weeds. This seed, after having
been kept carefully during the winter, was sown in a
prepared bed, in the spring of 1848, in drills about
eighteen inches apart. As the plants grew they were
duly thinned out, leaving for the crop, as far as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
could be done, the specimens that had leaves with the
broadest divisions, lightest colour, and fewest hairs.
As cultivated parsnips offer a curious contrast with
the wild specimens in these respects, we place the
following notes, side by side, on the root-leaves of
plants of the same period of growth.</p>

<p>We have before remarked that neither in size
nor form are the wild roots at all comparable with
the cultivated ones. Our <a href="#Fig001-2">figures</a> 1 and 2 were
taken from fine roots of the wild parsnip of the first
year&#8217;s growth; that is to say, just at the same time
as a crop parsnip would be at its best. They were
purposely taken from specimens obtained from the
same district as the seed with which our experiments
were commenced.</p>

<p>Our first crop of roots from the wild seed presented
great diversities in shape, being for the most part
even more forked than the originals, but still with
a general tendency to fleshiness. Of these the best
shaped were reserved for seeding; and having been
kept the greater part of the winter in sand, some six
of the best were planted in another plot for seed.
The seed, then, of 1849 was sown in the spring of
1850, in a freshly-prepared bed, the plants being
treated as before, the results showing a decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
improvement, with tendencies in some examples in
the following directions:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. The round-topped long-root, having a resemblance
to the Guernsey parsnip. (<i>Panais
long</i> of the French.)<br />

2nd. The hollow-crowned long-root. &#8220;Hollow-headed&#8221;
of the gardener. (<i>Panais Lisbonais</i>
type.)<br />

3rd. The short, thick turnip-shaped root. &#8220;Turnip-rooted&#8221;
of the gardener. (<i>Panais rond</i> form.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These three forms were all of them much mis-shapen,
with forked roots, that is, <i>fingers and toes</i>;
but still each of them offered opportunities of procuring
three original varieties from this new source.</p>

<p>As an example of progress, we offer the following
engraving of a specimen of our Round-topped parsnip
of 1852. <a href="#Fig003">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 3.</i>&#8212;Round-topped Parsnip, five generations from wild root.</p>
</div>

<p>This it will be seen has strong, fleshy forks, and
a tendency to form divided tap-roots; otherwise the
shape is greatly improved, and the skin is tolerably
smooth.</p>

<p>At this time our stock was for the most part fleshy
and soft on boiling; the flavour, too, though much
stronger than that of the usual esculent parsnip, was
rather agreeable than otherwise.</p>

<p>This matter of flavour is a subject of interest, as
most lovers of the parsnip, as a garden esculent, had
got to complain of this root becoming more and more
tasteless. That this was so our own experience most
fully confirms; we have now, however, mended this
root very materially in this respect.</p>

<p>Our experiments were only carried on with examples
of the Hollow-crowned form, which following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
out from year to year, we at length obtained so
perfect in form, clean in outline,
delicate in skin, and
unexceptionable in flavour,
that we were induced to cause
its seed to be distributed
through the medium of the
trade.</p>

<p>In 1881 we sowed a parcel
of seed in our own garden
obtained from the Messrs.
Sutton, after having received
from them the following notes
upon the growth of the roots
in their grounds:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

lover of this, to some, favorite root. In size it is
scarcely large enough for a field crop, but though
not at present recommenced for the farm, its history
may well serve to explain the origin of crop plants,

wild species.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ORIGIN OF SORTS OF ROOTS.</h4>

<p>As crop plants are derived from wild ones, as the
effect of cultivation, it follows as a matter of course
that these will be varied, both in form and constitution,
according to the circumstances under which
they have been produced. Thus we may expect that
any attempts to ennoble a wild root in different
countries would not, even if successful, be sure to
bring about the same results. Much depends even
upon the individual root with which our trial may
be started, and more upon the judgment employed in
selecting the stock from which the experiments are to
be continued.</p>

<p>That position and soil may make a great difference
may be inferred from the fact that the attempts to
improve the wild parsnip and carrot have met with
varied success. De Candolle is reported to have tried
to improve the carrot with success, whilst with the
parsnip he utterly failed; whilst Professor Lindley, in
Morton&#8217;s &#8220;Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture,&#8221; tells us that
M. Ponsard has ascertained that &#8220;the wild parsnip
becomes improved immediately when cultivated, and
that experiments in improving its quality promise
well:&#8221; how well, indeed, may be seen from the foregoing
chapter. But still, we utterly failed with the
wild carrot. Having collected seeds of the <i>Daucus
Carota</i> (the common wild carrot) from some fine specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
growing on the road-side between Cirencester
and Cheltenham, they were subjected to experiment
at the same time as the parsnip, but with little, if
any, favourable result. Upon this plant Professor
Lindley observes as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>That the hard-rooted wild carrot is really the parent of our
cultivated varieties, remarkable as they are for the succulence and
tenderness of their roots, has been experimentally proved by
M. Vilmorin, who succeeded in obtaining by cultivation perfectly
tender, eatable roots, from seeds saved from plants only three or four
generations off the wild species.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Still, a modern French naturalist of great experience,
M. Decaisne, tells us that he has tried to
ennoble the wild carrot, and has not succeeded; and
from this he draws the conclusion that our cultivated
forms were created specially for the use of man. As
we should suppose that very few botanists agree to
this theory, we shall let the facts we have already
brought forward stand in maintenance of its opposite,
namely, that cultivated forms are derived from wild
species often apparently very different; but at the
same time it may be well to state, that in all probability
some of the discrepancies of experimenters
may have arisen from some confusion in the species
operated upon.</p>

<p>In 1860 we gathered some seed of the <i>Daucus
maritima</i> (sea-side carrot) at Bognor, which, on being
sown in a prepared plot the following spring, certainly
resulted in fairly succulent roots, which on
being cooked were pronounced by our party of four
to be excellent. While on this subject, it may be
mentioned as not a little remarkable, that so many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
our garden esculents should be derived from sea-side
plants. Thus, probably carrot, but certainly celery,
sea-kale, asparagus, and cabbage. This would seem
to point to the fact that cultivation requires a complete
change of the circumstances necessary to maintain
a wild condition; and hence cultivated plants
can only be kept up by the labours of a cultivator.</p>

<p>Now, as regards the sea-side carrot, we are after
all inclined to the belief that it is the parent of the
cultivated varieties, whilst, on the other hand, we
view the <i>Daucus Carota</i> (the wild inland carrot) as
a probable descendant from the cultivated or garden
stock; and if this be so, the <i>Daucus maritima</i> is the
original species from which both the wild and cultivated
races have descended. Bentham, indeed, carries
this view a little further, the following remarks
tending to throw doubts upon the carrot in any
form as being a true native. Under the heading of
<i>Daucus Carota</i> he says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Probably an original native of the sea-coasts of modern Europe,
but of very ancient cultivation, and sows itself most readily, soon
degenerating to the wild form, with a slender root, and <i>now</i> most
abundant in fields, pastures, waste places, &amp;c., throughout Europe and
Russian Asia; common in Britain, especially near the sea. <i>Flowers
the whole summer and autumn.</i> A decidedly maritime variety, with
the leaves somewhat fleshy, with shorter segments, more or less
thickened peduncles, more spreading umbels, and more flattened
prickles to the fruits, is often considered as a distinct species.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seeing then that crop plants are derivatives from a
wild stock, we can readily understand how the varying
circumstances attendant upon the development of
the former should tend to the production of varieties,
and this merely as the result of the treatment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fairly derived legitimate seed. If, again, we take
these variations for the purpose of obtaining hybrids,
we need not wonder at the infinite variety of sorts
which can be brought about, but rather that any
sort could be maintained in that trueness of character
or in that state of permanency which we sometimes
find to be the case.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>ON TRUENESS OF SORT IN ROOT CROPS.</h4>

<p>The importance of trueness and purity of seed arises
from the evenness of growth of a good genuine strain;
while if this quality be wanting we have some parts
of our crop growing well, whilst others get on but
poorly. Thus a free-growing plant beside one over
which it has got the advantage, maintains it for the
most part through the whole period of growth.
Again, some sorts are of value for being early, others
for lateness of growth, and some kinds are better
fitted for early than late sowing; if, therefore, we have
a mixture in these respects, we may at least expect a
partial failure; for whichever is <i>best</i> for our purpose,
if mixed will be accompanied by those which are not
so good. A want of trueness to sort may arise principally
from the following causes:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. Want of selection in seeding bulbs.</p>

<p>2nd. Hybridization.</p>

<p>3rd. A mixture of seeds.</p>

<p>1st. The propriety of selecting the specimens from
which seed is to be grown is admitted by all: by the
seedsman, who always advertises his turnip and swede
seed, for example, as being &#8220;from selected bulbs;&#8221;
and by the farmer, as this announcement is only made
to induce him to buy. It is not only important that
the roots should be selected, but that they should be
stored and then planted in a fresh soil; for as these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
latter are among the <i>cultivative processes</i> by which
sorts have been obtained, so should they be repeated
in order to ensure a continuance of the induced condition.
Seeding upon the same soil and in the same
bed in which the seed is sown is hardly the way to
keep up a form induced by cultivation, as this is
exactly what would be done by the plants in a state
of wildness.</p>

<p>In selecting roots for seeding, care should be taken
to choose good-shaped examples, in which a clean
unbranched bulb, not too large, with a small tap-root
and a small top, confined to a single central bud; a
branched root and a many-headed top being true signs
of degeneracy. And no less so is neckiness in swedes
and mangels, as well as a coarse corrugated skin in
roots of all kinds.</p>

<p>Taking such points as these into consideration, how
absurd must appear most of the huge mis-shapen
roots to which prizes are usually awarded at shows,
where the specimens are chosen for size, and trimmed
up with the knife, to make them look more presentable.
As an evidence of the mistaken principles
upon which prizes are awarded to bundles of roots,
let any one seed such examples, and we will venture
to assert that such seed would produce a large proportion
of degenerate examples, without affording so
good a crop as would seed, from middle-sized but well-shapen
specimens.</p>

<p>2nd. Some of the forms of roots, and more especially
those belonging to the <i>Brassicace&aelig;</i>, such as
turnips and swedes, seem to have a wonderful facility
for hybridizing; and this not only to the extent of
one sort of turnip with another, but sports may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
caused by the fertilization of the turnip with rape
and its congeners. Indeed, the hybrid with turnip
and rape is doubtless the origin of the Swedish turnip;
but there is reason to believe that mixtures may
accidentally be made with such wild plants as charlocks
and mustards, the growth of which in the
vicinity of a seeding crop tends to the production of
degeneracy. Seeding-patches, then, and the ground
about them, cannot be kept too clean.</p>

<p>Again, if trueness be aimed at, there should be no
mixture of sorts in seeding examples; all of the
same kind should be selected for seeding-plots, as
even one or two of a wrong sort may result in a
very mixed sample, as it would seem that sometimes
strange plants exert more than ordinary influence.</p>

<p>Of course, the putting seeding-patches of different
sorts side by side is to be reprehended. If more
than one sort be seeded in a season, it is advisable to
place the patches as remote from each other as possible.
And we would here remark, that, for seeding, the
roots should, as a rule, be farther apart than when
grown for bulbs, both in rows and in sets; as, if too
close, the stems grow up thin instead of robust, and a
smaller seed, with a tendency to the growth of smaller
roots, will be the result.</p>

<p>3rd. Mixtures of seeds should be avoided for the
reason assigned, that &#8220;sorts&#8221; do not usually grow
evenly; and when one sees (as is by no means infrequent)
a patch of swedes overshadowed by a mixture
of some large early turnip,&#8212;the Tankard, for
example, our crop of swedes will certainly suffer for
it, even supposing the turnip to be as useful as the
swede, which is seldom the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Mixtures, again, do not come up at the same time;
sorts may differ in this respect, but especially do old
and new seeds vary as to their germinating powers:
two-year-old seeds taking four or five days more to
come up than a new sample; thus giving a greater
chance for the ravages of the flea-beetle than where
the seed all comes up quickly.</p>

<p>Now, as a practical application of these remarks,
we here quote from an article in the <i>Agricultural
Gazette</i> of May 24th, 1862.</p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Who among seedsmen does not profess to offer the seeds of swedes
and turnips from <i>selected bulbs</i>? And though it is quite true that the
practice is not so universal as is the profession of it, yet the general
assumption of its being so on the part of seed growers and sellers is
an admission that it would be for the advantage of the buyer of seeds
were the roots from which seeds are to be grown carefully selected.
And on the other hand, let the observant agriculturist take a journey
on any of our great lines of railway (in early summer), and he will
be struck with the many patches of bright yellow flowers which he
will not fail to notice on either hand. In nine cases out of ten,
these are fields or portions of fields of turnips, either the Swedish or
common kinds, which, from the abundance of keep, it has been thought
would be more profitable to seed than to eat off, especially as they
have so rapidly grown out of the way. Are these patches of selected
bulbs? We happen to know, from a more than ordinarily careful
examination, that not one <i>per cent.</i> of seeding-patches are from
selected roots; but they are seeded just as they grew, and we do not
know of a single instance where in such seeding the objectionable
roots have been removed; but we do know of plenty of cases where
the worst part of a field has been saved for seed, doubtless as the
most profitable way of dealing with it under the circumstances
wrought out by the spring of 1862.</p>

<p>Of course, this will all come into the market, and too much of it,
under a stereotyped declaration of &#8216;<i>from selected bulbs</i>.&#8217; That all the
seed grown in 1862 will be sown in 1863 is simply impossible; but
no matter, it will find a market somehow, some time. With such
facts as these before us, who can wonder that any plant should
become degenerate? Let some of the seed of this year be watched,<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and we will answer for its evil results; and if these be facts, it then
behoves the farmer to look well to pedigree in the matter of his seed.</p>

<p>But even here, his forethought must not end; for however select
the parent may be, there is still something in &#8216;bringing up;&#8217; for,
however good the <i>sort</i> of turnip, we shall not grow its seed in
perfection by selection merely, but we should <i>transplant</i> well-chosen
roots, and so put them in a new scene, away from subjects which
might contaminate them. This is indeed to bring them up in a
<i>good school</i>, for which their seed will amply repay the trouble and
expense.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4>ON DEGENERATE ROOTS.</h4>

<p>If the reader revert to page 6, <a href="#Fig003">Fig. 3</a>, he will
see that the progress from a wild to a better root-form
is marked by a more fleshy, but still a much
forked, or finger-and-toed example. Now as it is held
that a clear unbranched outline is essential to a well-formed
root crop of every kind, whenever a crop
becomes fingered-and-toed, it is looked upon as a
disease. It must be understood that we are here
speaking of finger-and-toe as distinct from anbury,
which latter is a decidedly diseased condition, whether
caused by insects or resulting, as some affirm, from a
defect in the soil.</p>

<p>The difference in the two states may be briefly
summed up as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p>The example of a root at <a href="#Fig003">page 6</a> is a good form
of a parsnip progressing from wildness to a better cultivated
form. We now offer an engraving (<a href="#Fig005">fig. 5</a>) of
a hollow-crowned crop parsnip, fingered-and-toed,
and evidently of a very objectionable form, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
will be seen on comparison how nearly alike are <a href="#Fig003">figs.
3</a> and <a href="#Fig005">5</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 5.</i>&#8212;Finger-and-toed degenerate Parsnip. Half nat. size.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, as every degenerate
crop of parsnips will be found
to offer a large proportion of
such roots as <a href="#Fig005">fig. 5</a>, we seem
bound to conclude that, inasmuch
as our <a href="#Fig003">fig. 3</a> <i>represents
a root in progress towards ennobling</i>,
so <a href="#Fig005">fig. 5</a> is that of a
root declining to its level,&#8212;in
other words, degenerating;
seed, therefore, that produces
such roots can only come
from a poor stock.</p>

<p>Our next fig. (<a href="#Fig006">6</a>) is of a
parsnip that had prematurely
flowered. Sending up flowered
stems the first year, in the
case of a biennial, can only
be looked upon as an instance
of degeneracy. Plants that
&#8220;run,&#8221; as it is termed, being
comparatively useless, the best
use, indeed, that can be made
of them being that of pulling
them up and giving them to
the pigs.</p>

<p>Now this propensity is always accompanied with

<a href="#Fig003">figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig005">5</a>, as those were fleshy and succulent; but

<p><a href="#Fig008">Fig. 8</a>, from a specimen of
White Belgian carrot, forked
as it is, is yet not uncommon;
still, here the divided roots
are succulent. This differs
from the annual or run-to-seed
roots, as this is a real biennial;
but its other mark of degeneracy,
besides that of finger-and-toe,
was in its possessing
a top (removed for experiment
before the drawing was made)
of many buds or heads. Now
a <i>multiheaded</i> root, whether
in turnips, carrots, parsnip, or
mangel, is another sign of
degeneracy, especially in the
carrot or mangel, as the
wild examples are remarkable for this condition; and
in ennobling these roots, one of the difficulties is to
get rid of this propensity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Hence, at root shows all forked examples of bulbs,
multiheaded and necky
examples, should be rejected;
they are, however,
sometimes made so fat
with manuring that they
pass muster for size, which
indeed seems to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
great quality required at shows: which is a serious
mistake, as being no sort of criterion of the state
of a field of roots, unless it be an adverse one: as
a 10 lb. malformed root, with its huge top, will
require more ground to grow than will half a dozen
roots averaging 2 lbs. each; whilst the latter are
certain to be better and will keep longer.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>EFFECTS OF GROWING SEED FROM DEGENERATE ROOTS.</h4>


<p>That the seed of malformed roots would be likely to
produce a poor crop was a subject admitted by all;
but neither the form nor extent of the mischief resulting
therefrom had been stated upon the authority of
exact experiment. In order, therefore, to arrive at
direct evidence upon a point upon which so much of
practical importance depends, we carefully carried
out the following experiments.</p>

<div class="figc400"><a name="Fig009" id="Fig009"></a>
<img src="images/illo031.png" alt="Malformed parsnip" width="350" height="334" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 9.</i> A Malformed or Degenerate Parsnip. Two-thirds of nat. size.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 26th of March, 1860, we selected two roots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from a store, namely, one of a Student parsnip from
our own stock and one of a Skirving&#8217;s swede. Before
committing these to the ground for the growth of
seed, we made careful portraits of the two roots, of
which that of the parsnip will be found in <a href="#Fig009">fig. 9</a>, that
of the swede in <a href="#Fig010">fig. 10</a>.</p>

<div class="figc300"><a name="Fig010" id="Fig010"></a>
<img src="images/illo032.png" alt="Malformed swede" width="250" height="524" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 10.</i> A Malformed or Degenerate Swede. Two-thirds of nat. size.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Now had we been going to grow the best of seed,
we should of course have selected the best-shaped
roots for our purpose; but in this case, as will be
seen, the most viciously formed examples were
chosen.</p>

<p>Both of the examples whose portraits we have here
given, were planted in our private garden (where, it
is right to say, they were the only seeding specimens),
in due time their seed ripened, which was
carefully collected and stored.</p>

<p>Early in April, 1861, these seeds were sown in our
experimental plots, <i>without manure</i>, in the following
order:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The plot <i>b</i> was sown by way of comparison, and we
can only regret that no plot of good swede seed was
sown with the same object, and we must, therefore,
compare with a piece of swedes in an adjoining field.</p>

<p>The roots from plot <i>a</i> may be described as small,
though not so much fingered-and-toed as we had
expected; still there was only about half the crop
when compared with plot <i>b</i>, which latter, indeed,
was only small in weight, which may be accounted
for from being grown without manure. During
their progress of growth the difference was very
perceptible&#8212;the small leaves of <i>a</i> contrasting most
unfavourably with the broader, brighter coloured
ones of <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>As regards the swedes, they were indeed a very
poor crop, presenting all the evils of degeneracy&#8212;neckiness,
for which it will be seen that their parent
was distinguished&#8212;want of a bulboid form; none
of the 70 roots being better than a thin tap-root,
and these were forked, shapeless, and fingered-and-toed
in endless variety. Their spindle-shaped roots
were quite remarkable, and they were the rule,
although in good seed, however bad the soil, they
would have been the exception. Those in the field
hard by were bulboid, and averaged half a pound
each&#8212;no great weight, as the land in which they
were grown is only second-rate. They, however,
were grown with manure, to which, of course, much
of the difference is due, and yet not so much as may
fairly be imputed to the difference in seed. From
these experiments we conclude:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>1st. That a degenerate stock will, as a rule, result
from the employment of degenerate or badly-grown
seed.<br />
2nd. That besides ugly, malformed roots, degenerated
seed does not produce nearly the weight
of crop of good seed, under the same circumstances
of growth.<br />
3rd. That by means of selection we may produce
roots that are well-shaped, and have the capabilities
of affording the best crop.<br />
4th. That by designedly selecting malformed degenerate
roots for seeding, we may produce a
seed that will result in as great or greater
degeneracy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;That these are important conclusions&#8221;&#8212;we quote
from the <i>Agricultural Gazette</i>&#8212;&#8220;few will be disposed
to deny. They have most interesting bearings on the
subject of vegetable physiology, and consequently
should be studied by the farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a practice much to be desired, that not only
should a proper choice be made of seeding examples,
but that there be a change of situation, and, if
possible, a time of storage before being planted
for seed. These are all cultivative processes, and
to the care with which they are carried out must
we look for permanence in our derivative root-crops.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly urged, that, as an efficient
sort of root has only been arrived at as the result of
great care&#8212;that is, by successful breeding,&#8212;so every
care must be taken for its maintenance. Defect in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
seed results in defect in the produce of that seed;
and downward tendencies of this kind are common
results of even most careful cultivation. With carelessness
in this respect we must not be surprised at
rapid degeneracy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ADULTERATION OF SEEDS, MORE PARTICULARLY
OF TURNIPS.</h4>


<p>In order to make the experiments which illustrate
this chapter tell their tale to the fullest extent, we
would set out with the two following postulates:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. All well-grown, well-preserved new seeds
should be <i>capable</i> of germinating to the extent
of at least 90 per cent.<br />
2nd. Seeds in general, and more especially turnip
seeds, as usually delivered to the farmer, are
generally <i>incapable</i> of germinating to the extent
of from 25 to 30 per cent., and very frequently
even more.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We shall hereafter see, that this want of germinating
power is too often the result of mixing charlock,
Indian rape, and the like, by way of adulteration,
which latter are killed to prevent &#8220;their telling tales.&#8221;
But to our experiments:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>A number of tin cases were made of the following
proportions: Length, 15 inches; width, 10 inches;
depth, 4 inches. These, which were well perforated
at the bottom, were divided across into ten equal
parts, each of which was filled to within an inch of
the rim, with a mixture of fine mould and silver sand.
In these, seeds of different sorts of turnips were
sown, and the whole was put into a bed of sand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
our forcing-house. We could, however, see no difference
in the results, nor could we trace any in the
germinal or cotyledon leaves of swedes, turnips, or
charlock. But, of course, samples of turnip-seed could
not be tested as to freedom from charlock by this
experiment, because charlock is killed before being
mixed with the turnip.</p>

<p>Now, seeing that we could get no trustworthy
results by this kind of experiment, it struck us that
our germination-pans might be used to test the germinating
power, not only of the samples we had
obtained for a different purpose, but of others also.
We first, then, counted a hundred of each of the
following sorts of seeds, and carefully dibbled them
in a fresh mixture of soil, in September, 1860; the
results, which were as carefully noted from day to
day, are shortly given in the following table:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>We would remark upon these results, that the
temperature of the house was kept at between 60&deg; and
70&deg;, and the greater part of the seeds came up in
four days; the numbers for the days, then, have
reference to the time occupied before all that would
germinate came up. Now this table is not a little
instructive, as showing that samples of turnip-seed
can be got in which only a very few of the seeds fail
to germinate; but as experience had taught us that
these samples by no means represented the usual
market condition of turnip-seeds, in order to test this
we begged to be allowed permission to take samples
direct from the bags of a retail seedsman as they
were exposed in his shop, and the following results
will speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It should, however, be here premised that the
samples were not grown by the seedsman, but were
said to be just as received from the wholesale dealers.</p>

swede, grown in our own garden (8), of the
following table, and another of turnip (9), grown on
a neighbouring farm. We may remark upon the
last-named sample, that we had observed the growth
of this seed, which was from a very poor crop, half of
which had decayed on the ground with the early
frost of 1860, and the rest, without transplanting or
selection of any kind, was allowed to seed. Now, as
this whole crop was so degenerated that it ought
never to have been seeded at all, we were anxious to
get some of the seed from the bulk, in order to test
from its growth this year whether it will not bring
forth a degenerate progeny. Its germinating qualities
will be seen from the table, and yet it is by no means
the worst sample, which seems to show that the
others are not naturally bad, but so by mixture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Now, as &#8220;0 0 0&#8221; seed is supplied to customers
under the designation here given, for the purpose
of mixing, it is of little consequence whether it be
used by the wholesale house or the retail dealer;
if, however, it be employed by both, we should,
indeed, get a bad sample.</p>

<p>As regards the seedsman&#8217;s samples in the <a href="#TableVI_2">Tables 2</a>
and <a href="#TableVI_3">3</a>, we are quite unable to give exact details of
their history, but we have reason to believe that the
stock whence they were taken was purchased in the
ordinary course of business from different &#8220;wholesale
houses,&#8221; as, though the tradesman whence the
samples came combines the business of &#8220;nurseryman&#8221;
with that of seedsman, we happen to know
that he is not a grower of seeds, at least of turnip
seeds. The average, then, of eighteen samples of
turnips and swedes from this source is that 28 <i>per
cent.</i> are non-germinating seeds. The next samples
are from people in a large way of business, who are
not mere retailers, but to whom we must accord all
the immunities of the trade as seed-growers, wholesale
and retail seed-merchants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before giving the tables with the results as regards
these samples, it is necessary to state that they were
not sent to us direct, but were forwarded through a
farmer to whom they were sent in the ordinary small
packet samples.</p>

<p>We would further remark, that as all that would
germinate took so few days about it, being an average
of six days, whilst those of <a href="#TableVI_1">Table 1</a>, being seeds partly
of 1859 and partly of 1860, occupied nine days, and
those of <a href="#TableVI_2">Table 2</a>, whose date we do not know, eleven
days; in all probability the seeds in question were
tolerably new, most probably of the last seed season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Of these samples we see that within a fraction of
30 per cent. is the average of non-germinating seeds,
and this is only so low on account of two or three
unusually good samples, the general range being from
20 to 30 per cent. of non-germinating seeds for the
last twenty samples.</p>

<p>If we compare No. 5, <a href="#TableVI_2">Table 2</a>, with No. 4, <a href="#TableVI_4">Table 4</a>,
we see a difference in the Orange Jelly Turnip; in
the former little more than half came up, in the latter
every seed. This is of importance, as showing what
genuine seed may be, the latter being doubtless as
unmixed as the former was mixed.</p>

<p>Now as regards the charge of mixing, we are not
going to make it without some evidence. In looking
over the tables we have now given, it will be seen that
genuine seed has but a small per-centage of non-germinating
seeds&#8212;say from 5 to 10 per cent.; but
not only the examples herein referred to, with hosts
of separate ones which have fallen under our notice,
show a general amount of dead seeds, of from 20 to
30 per cent. For these figures compare <a href="#TableVI_1">Table 1</a> with
<a href="#TableVI_2">Tables 2</a>, <a href="#TableVI_3">3</a>, <a href="#TableVI_4">4</a>, and <a href="#TableVI_5">5</a>. In those of the first lot the
samples were sent direct to us from a seedsman, and
their behaviour shows us clearly enough that good
seeds are to be obtained, but the other tables are as
clear that from <i>some</i> seedsmen, at any rate, though
inferior samples, they are as good as are actually sold.</p>

<p>That seeds are mixed we have, then, good internal
evidence; but we are also in possession of facts more
conclusive upon this important point, and we shall
in this next chapter endeavour to enlighten our
readers as to the art and mystery (especially) of
turnip-seed adulteration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Confining our present remarks to turnip seeds,
we assert that if farmers will try the germinating
powers from the <i>bulk</i> of the seed which may be sent
to them, they will find pretty nearly one-third to be
rubbish. It is of no use to try from samples, except
in comparison with bulk; and if all the farmers of
Great Britain did this, and would communicate the
results, what an extraordinary tale would be unfolded,
more especially if the evidence be completed by notes
on the purity or otherwise of the crop grown from
such seeds!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ART AND MYSTERY OF TURNIP-SEED
ADULTERATION.</h4>

<p>It has already been shown that turnip-seed is largely
adulterated; it remains now to point out the nature of
the admixtures, which may be summed up under the
following heads:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st. Old seeds are mixed with new.<br />
2nd. Charlock, &#8220;Indian rape,&#8221; and other seeds
of the <i>Brassicace&aelig;</i>, are mixed with genuine
seed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>1st.&#8212;The crops of seeds vary so much in their
produce per acre, in one year, as compared with
another, that in most years there is a superabundance
of some kinds and a scarcity of others.</p>

<p>Now, as most seeds are of comparatively little use
except for sowing, the surplus stock can only be disposed
of at extremely low prices. Accordingly some
wholesale seedsmen buy large quantities in the &#8220;glut
season,&#8221; as it is termed, and store them until the
same articles fail in crop. For instance, swede and
turnip seeds, 1857 crop, could be bought everywhere
at from 15 to 20 shillings per bushel; but owing to
the destruction of the roots in the winter of 1859,
seedsmen in 1860 had to pay the growers 50s. per
bushel. Now, in 1860 there were wholesale houses
selling those seeds which they had by them for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
same price. Such people can, it is true, warrant
their seeds to be genuine, as they well know how
much turnip-seeds deteriorate by keeping; the mixing
of this with good seed is still a species of adulteration;
and if not mixed at all, we can then only say
that the evil is so much the greater.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the amount of deterioration
caused to turnip-seeds by keeping, we here re-produce
the table of trials of ten sorts of good seeds made in
September, 1860, in contrast with experiments from
the same sample, in the same month of the present
year (1862), premising that the samples were kept in
what we should consider a dry but not too warm a
temperature.</p>

<p>These figures are interesting as showing that though
the different sorts are not affected equally, yet the
seed of 1859 failed on the average to the extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
38.8 per cent., as against 24.6 for the seed of 1860,
and 28 as the average of the whole samples. Such
is the great difference between two and three year
old seeds.</p>

<p>2nd.&#8212;Even the above <i>genuine seeds</i> (!) are not
unfrequently mixed, and we may now examine the
nature of some of these mixtures. Charlock and
Indian rape are all <i>prepared</i> for this purpose: that
is to say, they are rendered incapable of germinating
before mixture&#8212;&#8220;Dead men tell no tales.&#8221; Now
rubbish, so prepared, is well known in the trade as
000 seed. Under this denomination all seedsmen
know it, and it can be procured by the trade at about
7s. per bushel.</p>

<p>With respect to this 000 seed, we direct attention
to the following letter addressed to a most respectable
firm.</p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p class="rightsig"><span class="smcap">Southampton</span>, <i>April 27, 1860</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&#8212;Being in possession of a new and improved method
of killing seeds without the use of any chemicals, so that the seed when
in a 000 state has not that unpleasant smell it has when killed by
the old method, and does not look perished if it be crushed. A man
by the new process may kill ten or twelve quarters per day, and the
apparatus is so constructed that it is impossible for a single seed to
leave it alive; and one great advantage is, that if you want a sack of
000 seed in a hurry you may kill a sack of rape or turnip, or any
seed, and have it fit for use in an hour. Seed in the process of killing
increases in measure and weight, and when you send it out to be
killed, of course, the seed-killers keep the extra weight and measure.
If you think it worth your attention, I will send you a small working
model, so that you may kill a few pounds of kale or cauliflower, or
any small seeds in a few minutes, and instructions for making a large
one on receipt of a Post-office order for &pound;2.</p>

<p class="rightsigleft">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="rightsig">&#8212;&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>To this the Messrs. Sutton append the following
remarks:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The writer of the above being unknown to us, we had the curiosity
to call at the address given, and ascertained that it was no &#8220;hoax,&#8221;
but was assured by the &#8220;inventor&#8221; that he had supplied several
tradesmen with the apparatus, and that he was <i>formerly</i> in the seed
trade himself. We may add, that we have since heard from the
same individual at another sea-port town to which he has removed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Having got possession of this circular, and being
desirous of becoming acquainted with so notable an
invention, we lost no time in setting on foot a negotiation
for the possession of the secret, and having
traced the inventor in his removal from Southampton
to Gosport, we then had letters addressed to him
upon the subject, and, if promises had been of any
avail, we might possibly at this time have been in
possession of a very improved and expeditious method
of making 000 seeds, only that we have learnt the
undesirable nature of pay beforehand.</p>

<p>Our next inquiry was for a sample of 000 seed
itself; but, although it is well known in the trade, we
have hitherto failed in procuring it. We had hoped
that our seedsmen might have been able to procure
some through some of their friends. The result
was, that we made application to a most respectable
London firm, receiving the following reply:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

request for a sample of 000 turnips, if we can obtain it. But we do
not keep it ourselves, nor do we know the parties who prepare it, it
being something of a trade secret. We will, however, apply to some
of our friends here to let us have a small quantity, but doubt if they<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
will let us have it, as it is a matter they are rather chary respecting,
and <i>although perfectly well known and understood in the trade, they do
not care to have it known beyond</i>, and our asking for a small quantity
will be sure to lead to the question, &#8220;What do we want it for?&#8221; We
could obtain a large quantity without hesitation.</p>

<p class="rightsigleft">We remain, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="rightsig">&#8212;&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The sentence we have placed in italics will be quite
sufficient to show how well the matter of 000 seeds
is understood in the trade, and how easy it is to get
bushels of it, no questions being asked, while a small
quantity, required only for investigation, may be
refused.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the machinery exists by
which any one in the seed trade may quietly and
easily commit enormous frauds. And it is plain that
the very notoriety of this machinery, together with
the condition of many of the samples of seed which
we have examined (see <a href="#Page_29">Chap. VI.</a>) prove that this
machinery actually is employed by many seedsmen
to the great injury of their customers.</p>

<p>We cannot, then, be doing wrong in urging any one
to make trial of the seeds he is about to buy before
he sows them, or even before he purchases them.
Where the experience of a number of years already
exists, the character of the seedsman is a guarantee
for the good quality of his goods, and experience of
this kind is indeed a more perfect carrying out of the
system of preliminary trial or experiment, which we
recommend especially to all new customers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</h4>

<p>Root-crops are especially liable to injury from the
depredations of insects. Thus the turnip may have its
seed more or less destroyed by weevils. Immediately
the seed appears above the ground, commences the
attack by the turnip flea-beetles. The bulb is pierced
by beetles, ending in those excrescences called &#8220;turnip-warbles;&#8221;
and there is reason to think that even
the root-fibrils are in some soils made the depositories
of the eggs of insects, which give rise to extraordinary
malformations.</p>

<p>Carrots and parsnips are liable to have the best-grown
root made useless by its being pierced and
eaten by the larv&aelig; or grubs of a small fly, known as
the <i>Psila ros&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Even the mangel-wurzel, which has been so
strenuously recommended as a substitute for the
turnip on account of its freedom from insect attacks,
and connected with which Curtis only describes a
single insect, a leaf-miner, called <i>Anthomyia Bet&aelig;</i>,
upon which he remarks that &#8220;these insects will
seldom cause any loss to the mangel-wurzel crops
should they ever abound to any extent.&#8221; In spite,
however, of this, we find that the increased growth
of this crop has caused a corresponding increase in
the insect, to such an extent that, during the last two
seasons, many crops have entirely failed from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
depredations; as witness the following communication
to the <i>Agricultural Gazette</i> for August 23rd, 1862:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>My mangel crop was drilled the 17th May, and came up most
favourably. On Monday, the 2nd June, I asked my bailiff what was
the matter with it; he said, &#8220;Oh, it was a sharp frost last night;&#8221;
but on examination I found that instead of frost the leaves had
within them a maggot, which had caused the plant to brown and die
off. The late rains and growing weather have enabled the plant
somewhat to revive, and also fresh plants to come up (for I had
drilled 7 lb. per acre), but found to-day several leaves with maggots
in them. My man told me &#8220;a quantity had eaten themselves out of
the leaf and dropped;&#8221; and that he saw &#8220;a vast number of sparrows
picking up those maggots.&#8221; I send you herewith some plants I
brought up from the farm. My idea is that the seed was damp and
bred the maggots, or that the leaves had been &#8220;struck with a fly,&#8221;
and then the maggot followed. You will please let me have your
ideas upon these points.&#8212;S. S.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The maggot, or larv&aelig;, here described is that of a
fly called the <i>Anthomyia (Pegomyia) bet&aelig;</i>, mangel-wurzel
fly. An allied species will sometimes be found
on the common dock-leaves, mining their galleries
between the dermal cells of the leaves.</p>

<p>We have for some time observed the increase of
this pest, and we are prepared to state that now we
seldom see a crop that is not greatly injured by its
attacks. Mr. Curtis thinks that the best method to
destroy them is to employ boys to crush the leaves
between the thumb and fingers at the part where the
larv&aelig; can be seen; and with this we fear we must
for the present be content, unless we could devise
some means to take the fly before its eggs are laid
in the leaves.</p>

<p>We need not here dwell at length upon the natural
history of those pests of the turnip&#8212;the <i>Haltica
nemorum</i> (striped flea-beetle), and <i>H. concinna</i> (black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
flea-beetle), as the nature of their ravages are tolerably
well known. Thus much, however, may be said;
namely:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a.</i> These insects are called fleas because they have the
power of hopping on being disturbed, much
after the manner of a flea.<br />
<i>b.</i> They have some five or six broods each year; the
earlier ones probably being bred on charlocks
and other weeds of the same natural order
as the turnip; and hence, then, charlocks are
pests, not only as being weeds, but as breeding-places
for one of our most mischievous insects.<br />
<i>c.</i> They migrate from their weed-haunts to the first
crop of turnips, where much of their mischief
may be prevented by simply dusting over the
young plants with any fine powder, road-dirt
answering the purpose as well as anything
else.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Various devices have been employed for keeping
away and killing these little creatures. We have
used a contrivance for catching them, which may be
described as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Some thin board (or boards), making a surface of
about 4 feet long by 2 feet wide, is furnished at one
end with a pair of light wheels of just sufficient
diameter to lift the board about 2 or 3 inches above
the plants. To the other end may be attached two
crooked handles in such a manner that the machine
can be wheeled flatly over the plants, or if four wheels
be employed, one at each corner, a single handle can
be used either to push or pull the implement. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
used, it should have its underside painted over with
tar or any handy viscid substance.</p>

<p>This should be used on bright days, the operator
pushing it over the rows of turnips, so as, if possible,
not to throw his shadow before. The middle of the
day will be best, not only for this reason, but also
because these creatures feed more actively at that
time.</p>

<p>Now, our experience in the use of this simple contrivance
on small experimental plots convinces us that
a small boy could easily keep under the enemy in a
good-sized field.</p>

<p>But now comes a very important question for consideration.
Cannot we do more than kill a few of
these creatures? cannot we adopt such plans as will
render our <i>crops</i> tolerably safe from their depredations?
We think so, and to this end advise the
following method of proceeding:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Let each turnip-grower prepare for the enemy by
sowing from the eighth to a quarter of an acre of
turnips in a sunny part of the farm as early as the
first week in April. These patches would quickly
attract all the turnip flea-beetles from the wild <i>crucifer&aelig;</i>
on which the first broods seem to depend, and
in this small compass they can be killed in detail
with the simple contrivance just described, so that
when the real crop comes up there will be none, or
at least only a few, beetles to emigrate to it; whereas,
as we now manage, by the time the crop of turnips is
sown, enough of the creatures are too often bred to
render it necessary to sow two or three times before
we can secure a crop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><i>Anbury</i> is an affection to which only the different
sorts of turnips are liable, in which case it differs
from finger-and-toe, with which it has been very
much confounded, as this latter occurs in all kinds of
roots; namely, turnips, carrots, mangel-wurzel, &amp;c.,
as well as both the common and Swedish turnips.</p>

<p>As a sample of an extreme
case of finger-and-toe&#8212;<i>digitate</i>
root,&#8212;we repeat
the following <a href="#Fig011">figure</a>
of a Belgian carrot, in
which it will be seen that
the forks gradually taper
to the extremities; in fact,
the whole, instead of being
a succulent fleshy tap or
<i>fusiform</i> root, in which case
it could readily be stored,
is divided in fingers-and-toes,
which are liable
to break off, and this renders
the product next to
useless. Now, this affection
may occur in any
soil, as it is the result of
a degeneracy in the stock
of the plant; but in the
affection now to be described
the case is wholly
different, as here the bulk
of the swede (<a href="#Fig012">fig. 12</a>) is affected with rough, cancerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
knobs, whilst the rootlets support irregular
knobs of a like kind, which have more the aspect
of suspended rows of ginger than fingers-and-toes.</p>

<div class="figc300"><a name="Fig011" id="Fig011"></a>
<img src="images/illo029b.png" alt="Finger-and-toe carrot" width="166" height="401" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 11</i> (Fig. 8 repeated).<br />
Finger-and-toe Carrot. Half natural size.</p>
</div>

<p>Roots so affected soon rot, and have a f&#339;tid odour,
so that they are not only useless themselves, but
communicate canker and decay to the whole store.
In the putrid mass will be found maggots and flies
and beetles of different kinds; but as yet naturalists
are not agreed as to whether the nodules of disease
are caused by insects, or whether these creatures are
merely attracted by the f&#339;tid matter. We are, however,
inclined to the belief that some insects are
connected with the diseased appearance in the first
place, whilst others afterwards step in to fatten upon
the decaying matter, induced by the first lot; but
still it must be confessed that the subject requires
much more attention than it has yet received, in
order to settle these important questions.</p>

<p>Still it may be observed that one point has been
universally admitted; namely, that anbury only
occurs to any extent in sandy soils, where there is
an absence of lime, a good dressing of which mineral
is the best safeguard against this affection. Still, in
soils that are liable to anbury, we should not recommend
the continuance of turnip-growing, or at least
not so frequently in the rotation as has hitherto been
the case, and more especially as the soils which produce
anbury to the greatest extent are just those
best adapted for parsnips and carrots, which, if not
wholly, may occasionally be very profitably grown in
the place of the turnip.</p>

<p>Having given a few notes on the more prominent
forms of insect attacks to which root crops are liable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
we would now close this chapter, as details of all the
insect pests would occupy more space than we can
here allot to the subject; but to those who would
inquire further upon this fertile theme, we would
advise the perusal of &#8220;Farm Insects,&#8221; by J. Curtis,
Esq., F.L.S., &amp;c.</p>

<h3>GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>To render our subject as complete as possible, we
direct attention to the following practical conclusions,
to which our whole argument upon the science
of root-growing points:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>First.&#8212;Cultivated roots are improved wild ones, only
to be obtained by gardening on the small, or
farming on the large scale; this gardening or
farming being carried on by certain operations
at certain seasons which we have comprehended
under the term of cultivation processes.</p>

<p>Second.&#8212;The difference in sort of roots is caused
either by cross-breeding as the result of accident
or design, or of the education of some particular
propensity which has been acted upon by the
intelligent seed-grower.</p>

<p>Third.&#8212;The maintenance of sorts in purity depends
upon careful selection of the right variety for
the seeding examples.</p>

<p>Fourth.&#8212;The preservation of a good outline or shape
of root can only be maintained by selecting those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of good <i>form</i> to seed from; for, as running to
seed, multiform top, forkiness, &#8220;finger-and-toe&#8221;
in roots, is evidence of wild growth, so, then,
cultivated plants assuming this form are considered
as degenerate, and seed from such roots
produces a malformed and poor crop.</p>

<p>Fifth.&#8212;The difficulties of getting good seed&#8212;whether
of trueness to sort, from carefully selected bulbs,
or free from adulteration either of old with new
seed, or a mixture of charlock and others of the
same family&#8212;are very great. Where, however,
good seed can be depended upon, it is much
cheaper, though at a considerable increase of first
seeds cost, as not only quality but the quantity of
live so considerably depends upon the truth and
honesty of the seedsman.</p>

<p>Sixth.&#8212;Injuries from insect attacks, though serious
as affecting the yield, are yet not due to the
seed; and anbury, if it be due to insects, only
occurs in the turnip-crops, and then in particular
soils. The true insect attacks to be averted
by simultaneous action.</p>

<p>In fine.&#8212;<i>Good seed, of a true sort,&#8212;care in growth,&#8212;and
a watchfulness of enemies, includes the</i>
<span class="smcap">Science</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Practice</span> <i>of Root Cultivation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Popular Science Review</span> is, as its name implies, a Review conveying scientific
knowledge in such a simple and popular form, that all who read may understand.
There is at the present day a numerous and increasing class of intelligent readers who,
without being scientific, are nevertheless greatly interested in scientific progress. They
would willingly become acquainted with scientific truths, but are too often deterred
from the pursuit of such studies by the abstruse or technical language in which these truths
are conveyed. In order to meet the requirements of this portion of the community, every
available means has been adopted to procure the most accurate information on all subjects
of which the journal treats. No pains or expense has been spared to secure the most skilful
artists to illustrate its pages.</p>

<p>Each number contains systematic, instructive articles (illustrated when needful) on
subjects connected with some of the following sciences, viz.:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD GRASSES.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4>ON THE NATURE OF MEADOWS AND PASTURES.</h4>

<p>The terms &#8220;meadow&#8221; and &#8220;pasture&#8221; are usually
employed together, as though they were really distinct
things; yet few people think of them as
different,&#8212;the fact being, that when a field is occupied
with grass, it may be called a <i>meadow</i>, in contradistinction
to that land under the plough, or
<i>arable</i>: this yields meadow-hay if mowed for that
purpose, or <i>pasturage</i> when fed off or depastured by
our flocks or herds.</p>

<p>The meadow, then, as being fixed, is termed &#8220;permanent
pasture.&#8221; Pasture-herbage, however, is grown
in the shifting crops of arable cultivation; in which
case it gets the term of &#8220;artificial pasture.&#8221; Hay
from the first of these is called &#8220;meadow-hay,&#8221;
whilst the mixture of grasses, clovers, &amp;c., gets the
name of &#8220;artificial grass,&#8221; or &#8220;hay,&#8221; as the case
may be.</p>

<p>As regards permanent pasture, this may be <i>old</i> or
<i>new</i>,&#8212;some meadows having been in green herbage
even for centuries, whilst others, though sufficiently
old, yet show traces of having been once arable in
the more or less high-backed ridges left by ancient
ploughing. Viewed in this way, original pasture is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
not so extensive as may be supposed; indeed, there
is scarcely such a thing at all, as all pastures are the
result of something like cultivation,&#8212;as, left to themselves,
that is, to Nature, they would soon resume
the aspect of jungle, moor, or marsh, according to
soil and situation.</p>

<p>Meadows and pastures may, then, for our present
purpose, be conveniently tabulated as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">a. Permanent Pastures.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Moors and uplands</i>, unenclosed or but partially
fenced in.<br />
2. <i>Commons</i>, unenclosed land, usually about
villages, conferring the right of cattle and
goose grazing.<br />
3. <i>River flats</i> and lowlands, liable to floods.<br />
4. <i>Irrigated Meadow</i>, in which the water is
controllable.<br />
5. <i>Meadows</i>, or permanent grass enclosures.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">b. Artificial Pastures.</span></p>

<p>6. <i>Seeds</i>, shifting crops of some grasses, clovers,
saintfoin, &amp;c., used either mixed or separately.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>1. Moors, uplands, and downs (such as Dartmoor
and Salisbury Plain) are more or less wild according
to their elevation and the geological formation on
which they occur. They consist of large tracts of
land either without fences at all, or only those of
the most inefficient kind, rather boundary-lines than
otherwise. They are never used for haymaking, nor
are they cultivated beyond depasturing. These are
dotted with patches of rough grass, thorns, briers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and shrubs or stunted trees where the surface is
much broken, and the animals they are made to
carry are few; but on the more rounded and smooth
lines of the downs is a finer herbage, kept so not
only from the nature of the case, but from the fact
that such a position favours the more thickly stocking
it with that close-grazing animal the sheep.</p>

<p>These pasturages, though very extensive, are yet
being encroached upon by a higher cultivation, and
the hayfields one occasionally meets with around the
squatter&#8217;s cabin even in the wild mountainous parts
of Wales sufficiently testify to the greater productiveness
of which the most unfavourable districts are
capable.</p>

<p>2. The village common is sometimes extensive; it,
too, as the former, is only grazed. Many of them
have of late years been enclosed. Where much
depastured&#8212;and they usually carry as much stock
as they can bear&#8212;there is a remarkable absence of
plants other than grasses. Indeed, grass-herbage, and
usually of the best species, will prevail, unless in
places where there may be stagnant water, in which
cases a little drainage would produce a large public
benefit; but as what is everybody&#8217;s business is done
by no one, the common is too often left much wilder,
and thus made poorer than it need be.</p>

<p>3. The river flats here meant are, for the most
part, large fields partaking of the nature of common;
that is, certain farmers and others have the privilege
of grazing during the autumn; but it is <i>aimed up</i>
early in spring, for the purpose of taking a crop of
hay. Such lands would be impoverished by such
constant haymaking; but the winter floods leave behind
them a deposit of silt and fluviatile materials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and perhaps beside act as a solvent; so that their
fertility is wonderfully maintained.</p>

<p>Many such wide stretches of meadow occur on the
banks of the Severn, as in the neighbourhood of
Gloucester, Tewkesbury, Worcester, &amp;c., where they
get the name of <i>Ham</i>. It is much to be regretted
that these hams are not made the most of, for the
same reason as applies with respect to common, for
the want of some efficient officer to direct improvements;
and so from the water here and there stagnating
good herbage is ruined, and from the floods not being
controllable, even hay is lost with the summer freshets.
But where such land is vested in single enterprising
proprietors, not only is drainage insured, but embankments
are made to keep out the waters when not
required, as so much met with on the banks of the
Thames; and such fields are at once an evidence of
the capabilities of river flats, and the great importance
of individual enterprise.</p>

<p>4. The last case approaches very nearly to that of
<i>irrigated</i> meadows; but these latter are mostly situate
on small streams, which can be directed to flow
through, not over them, at any time: they offer a
most important means of augmenting our pasturage in
certain districts, and will therefore receive a chapter
to themselves.</p>

<p>5. Permanent grass enclosures are of very varied
sizes, from hundreds of acres, forming perhaps a park,
to the small meadow of the homestead; they may be
seldom or never used for haymaking, but most of
them are aimed up for hay once, twice, or thrice in
four or five years. These form the greater part of
the grass-lands of our country, and are indeed
nowhere greener or more productive than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
British Isles; still, as we are an advocate for their
cultivation&#8212;which, if it does not quite realize the
position of making two blades of grass grow where
one grew before, may at least do much in this
direction&#8212;we shall reserve further remarks upon this
subject until we have particularly analyzed the
contents of a meadow.</p>

<p>6. As shifting crops, grasses, and other fodder
plants may be made exceedingly useful, these may
therefore well occupy a chapter to themselves.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4>ON THE SPECIES OF MEADOW-GRASSES.</h4>

<p>Although we possess more than a hundred species
of native grasses, we shall rarely find a fourth of them
even in a wide range of meadows; and if we do so, it
is rather an argument against than in favour of the
quality of their herbage, as, so few are the best grasses
in number, that it is almost a law for the best
meadows to contain the fewest species of true grasses.</p>

<p>If, then, the good grasses be so few, whatever is
not of these must be inferior, and, indeed, so bad are
some grasses that they can only be considered as
weeds. These weed-like forms are known to the
farmer from his observing that the cattle usually
refuse to eat them, and hence he has got to call them
&#8220;sour grasses,&#8221;&#8212;a term which, though perhaps meant
to convey the idea that such are objectionable in
flavour, yet it is oftener that they are refused from
their want of flavour, or from some mechanical objection
arising from their roughness of growth, some
having sharp serrated cutting edges to their leaves,
whilst the spicular awns, so conspicuous in the beard
of barley, cause great irritation by sticking beneath
the tongue and in the gums. Of these, the first are
objectionable for pasture, the last for hay, and should,
therefore, not be found in really good meadows.</p>

<p>The figures and descriptions which follow are given
in illustration of some of the more usual meadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
species, which, though not fully or botanically described,
will yet aid the practical farmer in estimating
the species, and their value and significance, which
he will commonly find in his fields.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 13.</i> The Meadow Foxtail.</p>
</div>

<p>The Meadow Foxtail
(<i>Alopecurus pratensis</i>, <a href="#Fig013">fig.
13</a>) is an early species of
the <i>spicate</i> form&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, the
flowers grow close together,
into a more or less
dense head. It yields a
great quantity of herbage,
especially in moist situations;
and is particularly
adapted for the irrigated
meadow. It should be
distinguished from the
<i>A. geniculatus</i> (Kneeling
Foxtail), whose spike is
only about half the length
and size, as this is particularly
a water species,
so that if found when a
meadow is dry, it is yet an
evidence that water must
have lain where it occurs for a considerable period of
the year. Also from the <i>A. agrestis</i> (Slender Foxtail),
which has a longer and thinner spike, as this
latter is a weed in poor hungry clays, which is useless
except as serving to indicate that the land wants
perhaps both drainage and manure. Here, then, our
first genus presents us with species indicating the
varied conditions of rich meadow, wet places, and
poor arable; and it is this variableness in adaptability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that makes the grasses such important indicators of
the nature and condition of soils.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig014" id="Fig014"></a>
<img src="images/illo074.png" alt="Catstail grass" width="205" height="499" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 14.</i> The Catstail Grass.</p>
</div>

<p>The Catstail Grass (<i>Phleum
pratense</i>, <a href="#Fig014">fig. 14</a>) in general
form is not unlike the preceding,
but it is much rougher in
all its parts, and is one of the
latest instead of one of our
earliest species. Its name of
catstail is due to its rough
flowers, an enlarged drawing
of one of which is given at <i>a</i>.
It has also got the name of
Timothy Grass, from one Mr.
Timothy Hanson, an American,
to whom, probably, is
owing its first introduction as
a &#8220;self-crop,&#8221; large fields of
this useful species, mostly by
itself, being grown in Canada
and the States as a fodder
plant. It is very useful in
the meadow, as supplying a
late crop of stems and leaves;
greatly augmenting the amount of herbage in some
of the colder though not poor districts.</p>

<p>We have never seen this grass used as a self-crop
in England, but we are convinced that on some of the
rich alluvial flats, as in the lands reclaimed from the
Severn, and warp soils in general, it would yield a
large bulk of good feeding matter, which, though
somewhat rough, would yet mix well with clovers,
&amp;c., in chaff-cutting.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 15.</i> The Sweet Vernal Grass.</p>
</div>

<p>The Sweet Vernal Grass (<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig015">fig. 15</a>) is a very early species, with a somewhat lax
spike of flowers, which usually become of a bright
straw-colour by the time the hayfield is ripe for the
scythe. It does not yield much bulk, but its grateful
bitter when fresh, and the peculiarly sweet hayfield
odour which it yields on drying, would seem to make
this grass of importance, from the flavour which it
imparts to the produce of the field; indeed so much
so, that much of the value of natural meadow hay
over that of artificial pasture may be traced to the
presence of this grass.</p>

<p>The Crested Dogstail (<i>Cynosurus cristatus</i>, <a href="#Fig016">fig. 16</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
has its florets arranged in front of a series of abortive
branches, as represented at <i>a</i>, enlarged. It has a
very slender stem, which is hard and wiry when ripe&#8212;a
condition which it so universally attains, even in
spite of constant depasturing, that we never recommend
its use in mixtures for permanent pasture, as
its stems are particularly innutritious, and its herbage
is so small as to be of little value. It never prevails
much in our best pastures.</p>

<img src="images/illo076.png" alt="Rye grass" width="161" height="400" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 17.</i> Rye Grass, or Ray Grass.</p>
</div>

<p>Rye Grass, or Ray Grass
(<i>Lolium perenne</i>, <a href="#Fig017">fig. 17</a>), has
no connection with the Cereal
Rye. It is one of our commonest
and most useful species,
both as a plant for the natural
meadow or for arable culture,
especially in mixture with
clovers, which has the name
of &#8220;seeds.&#8221; It yields good
bulk for the rick, and will so
readily grow after cutting or
close depasturing that it commonly
affords the greater part
of the herbage of a pasture.
From being so valuable, its
seed has been much cultivated;
and as it has a tendency to
form more or less permanent
varieties, so we find in the
market several different sorts;
as &#8220;Pacey&#8217;s, Ruck&#8217;s, Russell&#8217;s,
Stickney&#8217;s, Rye Grass,&#8221; &amp;c. It should always form
part in any mixture in laying down permanent
pasture, in which case it should be distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
from the <i>Lolium Italicum</i>, the florets and seeds of
which are awned-pointed, as at <i>a</i>. This latter is
useful as an annual self-crop, but seedsmen too often
mix it in permanent-pasture collections, for the reason
that it grows faster, and so makes a show the first
year, and so satisfies the customer; but it soon
dies out, while its large growth has kept under the
more enduring forms. <i>b</i> represents a bunch of the
tumid flowers of the <i>Lolium temulentum</i> (Drunken
Darnel), once a pest in cornfields, but now, fortunately,
of rare occurrence, if we
are to believe the tales
told of its so-called poisonous
seeds.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 18.</i> The Cocksfoot.</p>
</div>

<p>The Cocksfoot (<i>Dactylis
glomerata</i>, <a href="#Fig018">fig. 18</a>),
though a large and somewhat
coarse grass, is by
no means inferior in quality,
its hay being highly
nutritious, whilst its cut
or cropped herbage is so
quick of growth that it is
capable of yielding a great
deal of keep. It sends
its root deep into the soil,
so that it can grow well
in poor land if dry; but it
never flourishes in very
wet situations. It is constant
in good meadows,
unless when they are always
depastured, as there the constant treading
greatly interferes with it: it is, therefore, by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
means so abundant in sheep pastures; whence has
arisen the idea with some farmers that &#8220;too much
sheep-grazing wears out the richer grasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>We should always recommend cocksfoot as a part
of mixtures for permanent pasture, taking care to
well roll the meadow once or twice a year&#8212;a process
of great importance&#8212;to keep the turf in an even pile,
and so prevent that growing of large clusters or
hassocks of one sort, a method of growth to which
the cocksfoot is somewhat prone.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 19.</i> The Rough-stalked Meadow Grass.</p>
</div>

<p>The Rough-stalked
Meadow Grass (<i>Poa
trivialis</i>, <a href="#Fig019">fig. 19</a>) is a
common species in
moist meadows, where
it often forms a considerable
portion of
the herbage: it is distinguished
from the
smooth-stalked by the
long-pointed tongue
(<i>ligule</i>) to the leaves
(<i><a href="#Fig019">a</a></i>), and a stem which
is somewhat rough to
the feel, especially
when drawn downwards
through the fingers.
This grass yields a
quantity of herbage,
but our experience
leads us to conclude
that it does not possess
quite so good a quality as Sinclair and authors who
have copied from him would lead us to suppose, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
have found it wanting in feeding qualities, or what
the farmer calls &#8220;proof.&#8221; It usually forms a large
part of the hay of the irrigated meadow, which,
though often large in quantity, is yet not equal to
that of ordinary good meadows in feeding properties.</p>

<p>The Smooth-stalked Meadow Grass (<i>Poa pratensis</i>),
distinguished by a blunt ligule (<i><a href="#Fig019">b</a></i>) and smooth stem, is
as abundant in dry situations as the former is in
damp ones. We confess to a great partiality for this
grass, notwithstanding that authors speak slightingly
of its value; but the truth is, that it varies with soil
and situation, it being a species which, when growing
on a wild moor, is poor in both quantity and quality.
But we know of no better sign of the improvement of
a bad meadow than the increase of this grass, and its
putting on, as it will do under such circumstances, of
its richest green tint.</p>

<p><i>Poa nemoralis</i> (Wood Meadow Grass) is a more
slender form, whose wild <i>habitat</i> is in woods and
shady places, especially on calcareous soils. This
points it out as a useful grass for wood-glades and
positions beneath trees, in which it may very properly
be employed.</p>

<p>In laying down permanent pastures we should, then,
employ these three poas as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Poa trivialis</i>, for low, damp situations and irrigated
meadows.<br />

<i>Poa pratensis</i>, for sound dry pastures and uplands.<br />

<i>Poa nemoralis</i>, for rides between woods, wood-glades,
and shady places.</p>

</div>

<p>Meadow Fescue (<i>Festuca pratensis</i>, <a href="#Fig020">fig. 20</a>) may be
taken as the type of the broad-leaved fescues. It is
a common and good succulent grass in rich meadows,
and should always be employed in seed mixtures for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
such situations, A variety, botanically known as
<i>F. loliacea</i>, is unbranched, like the lolium or rye
grass. The position of this is on rich river flats: we
have seen it on the banks of the Isis at Oxford,
forming a large part of most excellent herbage.</p>

<p>The Tall Fescue (<i>Festuca elatior</i>, <a href="#Fig021">fig. 21</a>) is a larger
and coarser form of <i>F. pratensis</i>, as seed of the latter
will become the former by being sown on some
stiff sandy clays. It occurs abundantly on the stiff
alluvial deposits of our estuaries and river flats. It
is an exceedingly coarse grass, with a tendency to
grow in large separate bunches; and hence its presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is destructive to good pastures: it may, however,
be encouraged as a rough growth in its indicated
<i>habitats</i>.</p>

<p>Sheep&#8217;s Fescue (<i>Festuca
ovina</i>, <a href="#Fig022">fig. 22</a>) may be
taken as the type of the
small-leaved fescues. It
is a native of our downs,
and forms a large proportion
of the sweet down
sheep-pastures. It is
known by its fine leaves,
which come up immediately
after the closest
feeding; and if its quantity
equalled its quality,
it would be even more
valuable than it is. A
larger form, the Hard
Fescue (<i>F. duriuscula</i>), is
common to sound meadows
and the hill valleys.
This has much the same
properties as the former,
but it is taller, with longer and broader leaves. This
should always be encouraged, and in laying down
grass for permanent pasture, it should be plentifully
added to the seed mixture.</p>

</div>

<p>The Downy Wild Oat (<i>Avena pubescens</i>, <a href="#Fig023">fig. 23</a>) is
a common grass on thin calcareous soils. As it is
very light in structure, and yields but little grass, it
is not worth much as a first-rate pasture plant,&#8212;and
indeed it would scarcely prefer to grow on them.</p>

<p>There is, however, a smaller-flowered species, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<i>Avena flavescens</i> (Yellow Oat-grass), which is better.
It, too, occurs on chalky soils; while the <i>Avena
pratensis</i> (Meadow Oat-grass)
is found too frequently
in poor clays or
on starved moors, in which
its rigid leaves and harsh
structure render it little,
if any, better than a
weed.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting
species of the
genus is the <i>Avena fatua</i>
(Wild Oat), well known
as a weed in stiff arable
soils. This is the parent
of the crop oats in cultivation,
and there is reason
to know that by
degeneracy the crop oat
in some districts leaves
behind a pest of wild
oats.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Oat-like Grass
(<i>Arrhenatherum avenaceum</i>, <a href="#Fig024">fig. 24</a>), though a tall,
succulent-looking species, is still too common in poor
soils, as its herbage is bitter and nauseous, and not
liked by cattle; and hay from it is always inferior in
quality. It is sometimes recommended by seedsmen,
and usually put with their mixtures; but we should
at all times refuse it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>There is a peculiar form of this which occasionally
occurs in sandy districts, called <i>A. avenaceum</i>, variety
<i>bulbosum</i> (Onion Couch), the trivial name of which
has been given from the fact that its nodes thicken
below the soil, and present the appearance of small
races of onions. This pest is got out of the land by
harrowing and hand-picking; but as every bulb grows
like joints of real couch, it is very difficult to entirely
eradicate it.</p>

<p>The Soft Brome, or Lop Grasses (<i>Bromus mollis</i>,

therefore very objectionable, whether in the meadow
or in &#8220;seeds,&#8221; to both of which, when poor and
neglected, it becomes attached. In both positions it
is sometimes mixed with a kind that droops pretty
considerably to one side; from which it has got the
name of &#8220;lop.&#8221; From the meadow it is soon got rid
of by manuring and depasturing; haymaking, though
it cuts off the main stem, only encourages smaller
ones to spring up late, and so the seed is sown. In
&#8220;seeds&#8221; it is frequently mixed with rye-grass seed,
as it too often occurs that a patch of rye-grass with
much lop is seeded, as the most profitable way to
deal with it, as its seeds are heavy and large, and
therefore tell well, either by weight or measure.
Our enlarged drawing of a seed with its envelopes
is given to contrast with rye-grass seed, which is
narrower and more pointed.</p>

<p>Within the last few years a species of brome
grass, which was formerly very rare, has become a
common weed: we mean the <i>B. arvensis</i>, Corn Brome-grass,&#8212;a
species with smaller and more numerous
heads of flowers than the one just described. This
has spread with the growth of foreign seeds, and
so suddenly has it appeared in some places as to
cause farmers to come to the conclusion that poor
cultivation has made the land spontaneously bring
forth &#8220;a nasty sort of wild oat,&#8221; while others have
even concluded that a cereal crop had been transformed
into this grass.</p>

<p>The <i>Bromus erectus</i> (Upright Brome Grass) is very
constant to poor calcareous soils. This is a perennial
species, but very poor indeed in feeding qualities;
however, it looks green in park-glades, and if kept
down by rough stock, it may then be made useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>The Bent Grass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>, <a href="#Fig026">fig. 26</a>) is
probably only a variety of the common marsh species,
<i>A. alba</i>. Under the
name of Fiorin Grass,
this plant has been
much extolled for the
meadow; but our experience
shows it to
vary in value according
to the nature of the
position in which it is
placed: as thus, in an
irrigated meadow it
sends up a large quantity
of quite rich pasturage,
whilst in poor
or dry districts its herbage
is hard and harsh,
and not at all relished
by cattle or sheep.</p>

<p>The form we have
figured is more particularly
agrarian where its
creeping underground
stem forms a kind of mischievous couch, and this,
united with a tangled growth derived from shoots
rooting above the ground, renders this one of the
most pernicious weeds, especially in thin soils, on
calcareous, brashy, or stony soils.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 27.</i> Woolly Soft Grass.</p>
</div>

<p>Woolly Soft Grass (<i>Holcus lanatus</i>, <a href="#Fig027">fig. 27</a>), though
exceedingly pretty from its contrast in colour and
form with its congeners, is still so worthless in point
of feeding properties as to be little, if any, better
than a weed. It is too abundant in some moist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
meadows; and where it forms a very large portion
of the herbage, it speaks of poverty as well as
wet, and would lead to the inference that a little
draining, less frequent haymaking, and liberal doses
of manure, would have a most decidedly beneficial
effect.</p>

<p>Quaking Grasses (<i>Briza media</i>, <a href="#Fig028">fig. 28</a>, <i>B. minor</i>, <i>a</i>,
and <i>B. maxima</i>, <i>b</i>), though certainly amongst our
pretty species, are all useless to the farmer. The
common species is well known in all wet or poor
clay meadows, and where very abundant we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
usually make our calculations for something less than
a ton of hay to the acre, and this would generally
be late, and offer little <i>aftermath</i>. Like the preceding,
its indications are want of draining, manure, and
depasturing. If after the drains begin to act, sheep
be folded upon a quaking-grass meadow, and fed with
turnips, hay, pease, or cake, it will soon be eradicated.
<i>a</i>, the smaller species, is an annual, and is only
noticed here by way of distinction: its smaller and
broader bunches of whitish, not purple, flowers, and
rectilinear branches, will distinguish it from the
common form. It is comparatively rare; but we
have had some fine specimens communicated by
H. C. Watson, Esq., from Thames Ditton. <i>b</i> is a
garden specimen, remarkable for its larger flower
bunches.</p>

</div>

<p>The Hair Grass (<i>Aira c&aelig;spitosa</i>, <a href="#Fig029">fig. 29</a>) is commonly
called hassock, or tussac grass, or bull-pates&#8212;names
which its massive bunches of root-leaves
clearly indicate the meaning of. Its leaves are so
rough, with serrated edges, that cattle mostly refuse
it, unless when very young. This grass is a never-failing
indicator of wet,&#8212;so much so, that if a meadow
be drained in which it abounds, the action of the
drains is clearly indicated by its more or less gradual
dying out. The quickest way, then, to subdue this
large, coarse weed-grass is to drain, and then fold
sheep upon the drying meadow: these animals tread
the tussac grass into manure, which goes to feed the
better species. By this means, not only this, but
other rough or &#8220;sour&#8221; grasses are more quickly and
more certainly removed than by spudding them out;
and this leads us to remark, in concluding this chapter,
that in the meadow there will usually be found growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
together two sets of grasses, which may be
designated as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>a.</i> Grasses more or less nutritious&#8212;sweet.<br />
<i>b.</i> Grasses more or less innutritious&#8212;sour.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In a good meadow, the section <i>a</i> maintain the
ascendancy, and so keep under those of <i>b</i>. In a
bad meadow, the section <i>b</i> will be master, and so
tyrannize over what would be better.</p>

<p>Perfect cultivation, then, of a meadow&#8212;for meadows
should be cultivated&#8212;whilst it encourages the
growth of <i>good</i> herbage, equally discourages the
progress of the <i>bad</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4>ON MEADOW PLANTS OTHER THAN GRASSES.</h4>

<p>With the grass of the field will usually be found
a large proportion of plants of a very varied, variable,
and different kind. Of these, many are useful as
augmenting the mass, and even improving the
quality of a pasture; whilst, as others are altogether
objectionable, we shall presently notice them under
the head of &#8220;Meadow Weeds.&#8221;</p>

</table>

<p>Of these, which are arranged pretty nearly in
their order of merit, the clovers are by far the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
important. These, as meadow plants, will usually
be found under the following circumstances:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. 1. Plentiful in good, rich, sound meadows.<br />

<span class="padl1 padr2">&#8222;</span>2. Frequent in meadows on light sandy soils.<br />

<span class="padl1 padr2">&#8222;</span>3. On thin but good soil, upland meadows.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The clovers, and indeed the clover allies, <i>Papilionace&aelig;</i>,
as a whole, are partial to lime,&#8212;so much
so, that a dressing of this mineral to some fields in
which clovers are scarcely represented will very
quickly cause an accelerated growth of them; hence
road dirt, when made from calcareous stones, as
are the <i>oolitic</i> and mountain limestones, affords
a good vehicle for the admixture of manures or
ameliorators, such as guano, burnt ashes, soot, nitrate
of soda, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following remarks upon these three clovers
are from a paper by the author in the <i>Bath and West
of England Agricultural Journal</i>, vol. x., part 2:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>1. <i>Trifolium pratense</i>&#8212;Meadow or Broad-leaved Clover&#8212;in its
wild state is too well known to need any lengthened description.
A careful examination of field specimens will show that even in the
wild state this plant is liable to run into numberless variations; thus,
we may have the leaflets of one plant broad and almost obcordate at
the extremity, whilst others will be more or less ovate and lancet-shaped.
In some we may see dense heads of purple flowers, varying
in shade until almost white, whilst less dense heads of flowers and
general variations in height, size, and luxuriance of the whole plant,
are all circumstances in the natural history of this species in the
wild state, which will prepare us duly to understand the nature of
the many forms of the plant which are found in cultivation. Of
these we have, besides others, English, French, American, and Dutch
sorts, which differ in such minor details as a greater or less hairiness,
or variations in the colour and size of the flowers, leaves, <i>&amp;c.</i> The
most important point connected with the broad-leaved clover is its
permanency; some sorts scarcely maintaining a plant for two years,
whilst others are said to be more or less perennial. This, however,
is a matter which we conceive depends more upon the soil and the<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
kind of cultivation than upon the sort; for although all seedsmen
supply two sorts, namely, <i>Trifolium pratense</i> and <i>T. pratense perenne</i>,
yet they run so much the one into the other, that it is oftentimes
exceedingly difficult to distinguish them. If, therefore, a farmer wants
a good strain of broad clover, he should purchase his seed from
seedsmen possessing judgment and character; for experience has
taught us that a seed which may be all that is required in one
district may result in next to a failure in another. Thus, clover-seed
from the warmer parts of England does not succeed well when
sown in cold, exposed positions; but that from the latter is improved
on transmission to the former, whilst good changes are effected by
the occasional use of foreign seed.</p>

<p>The sort known in the market as <i>T. pratense perenne</i> is probably
intermediate between the wild species <i>T. pratense</i> and <i>T. medium</i>.
Our own experiments have shown that, on cultivating <i>T. medium</i>,
which is a sand-lover, in strong land, in three years it has been very
difficult to distinguish it from some of the varieties of <i>T. pratense</i>.
We incline, therefore, to the opinion that as the <i>T. medium</i> holds to
sandy soils in the wild state, its seed was brought into cultivation
with a view to light-soil cropping; and from this source has probably
been derived the so-called <i>T. pratense perenne</i>, which variety is
certainly more perennial in such light soils as would be quite unfit
for the true <i>T. pratense</i>. The latter, indeed, seems to be more
permanent in soils containing a quantity of lime, while the former,
where it can be got of a good sort, is certainly best adapted for
sandy soils.</p>

<p>2. <i>Trifolium medium</i>&#8212;Zigzag Trefoil&#8212;is distinguished from the
<i>T. pratense</i> by its larger, but more lax, head of reddish pink (not
purple) flowers, which are solitary, on the apex of a stalk, which at
each joint is bent at a considerable angle; hence its name. Its
leaflets are elliptical, and not broader at the upper margin. This
plant is a constant denizen of sands and light soils. In fact, its
naturally growing in soils unfitted for the broad-leaved clover seems
to recommend it for cultivation; and though, as before pointed out,
we more than suspect that the so-called cow-grass clover was
originally derived from this source, and that the <i>T. medium</i> is after
all but a variety of the <i>T. pratense</i>, it is now quite merged as a
farm-plant into the broad-clover forms; so that, if we are to possess
it as a separate plant, it must be again grown from the wild seed;
and then, if it is to be kept pure, it must not be cultivated on clays
or limestones, or, if our view be correct, it will soon lose its true
distinctive character.</p>

<p>3. <i>Trifolium repens</i>&#8212;White Dutch Clover&#8212;has been long in cultivation<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
throughout Europe and America. It is one of our commonest
native plants, and appears to have become less changed by cultivation
than most other plants; yet there is reason to think that with careful
selection a much improved strain may be brought about. In pastures
an immense accession of Dutch clover is often seen to follow some
kind or another of top-dressing, especially of lime, old mortar, or
town rubbish. This is accounted for by the fact that this clover is
in reality of universal occurrence; and its creeping habit of growth,
besides seeding, causes it soon to make a rapid increase where its
conditions of growth are made suitable. As an agricultural plant its
position is in light soils, for which it is usually mixed with other
clovers and grasses in varied proportions.</p></blockquote>

<p>4 and 5 are often found scattered in meadows,
though not usually in any abundance in those of the
richer kind; still, in laying down land for permanent
pasture, there can be no objection to a small admixture
of their seed.</p>

<p>6, the <i>Purple Vetchling</i>, though local in rich
river pastures, is yet a good plant, and might
perhaps be advantageously brought out as an
addendum to mixtures designed for good lowland
positions.</p>

<p>7, <i>Saintfoin</i>, is a good pasture plant for chalks
and limestones; and in laying down land for permanent
pastures in such position, should not usually be
omitted. It is also a good species to sow on railway
banks, not alone for the beauty of its flowers, but for
the binding effects of its deeply-diving roots.</p>

<p>8 and 9, the <i>Burnets</i>, will be found,&#8212;the <i>true</i> in
rich damp bottoms and on river flats, the <i>false</i> on
dry, calcareous soils. They are neither plants that we
should care to grow; but in their wild state in their
respective pastures we should, on the other hand, not
be inclined to make war against them as weeds. The
same opinion, indeed, might be briefly expressed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
regards Nos. 10, 12, and 13. In fact, the whole here
grouped may be said to possess more or less bitter
and astringent qualities, and so become useful in
checking the vapidity which is sometimes found in
purely grass herbage.</p>

<p>11, the <i>Yarrow</i>, should be encouraged in most
pastures, as it not only possesses the qualities just
mentioned, but its leaves are so small and its stems
and flowers so easily dry when cut, that there is no
chance of its smothering out the grass in growing, or
of its retarding the process of haymaking. It also
bears constant nibbling with sheep, which are remarkably
fond of it, without injury, as it rather becomes
finer for being depastured.</p>

<p>12. The larger composite plants, as dandelion, the
hawkweeds, blackhead, &amp;c., are, from their coarseness
and the room they take up, highly objectionable;
but the yellow hawkbits, thrincia, and the before-mentioned
yarrow, are by no means objectionable.</p>

<p>13. The above remarks will equally apply to the
<i>Umbellifer&aelig;</i>. Large plants like the cow-parsnip and
common beaked parsley are objectionable from their
size and want of feeding properties, whilst the small
pimpinella and earth-nut do not offer these objections.
Here, however, it must be confessed that we are
bordering on the domains of weeds in pasture, to
which we must devote a separate chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE WEEDS OF PASTURE.</h4>

<p>&#8220;Weeds in pasture!&#8221; said an old farmer friend; &#8220;I
thought hay and grass was all weeds.&#8221; This, which
is by no means an uncommon notion, sufficiently explains
the want of care in the cultivation of the best
kinds of meadow produce, which can only be effected
by the destruction of what is useless or mischievous.</p>

<p>Now, if we proceed upon the assumption that the
best kinds of meadow are remarkable for the possession
of little else than the best kinds of the true
grasses, we shall see that pasturage should, in the
main, be composed of good grass-growth, with only
some few other plants which may be capable of augmenting
quantity, by their nutritive matter, giving
flavour, or improving quality.</p>

<p>It follows, then, that all plants having none of
these requisites must be, to all intents and purposes,
only <i>mischievous weeds</i>; as thus a large useless
plant in a meadow, as in an arable field, must not
only occupy the space that would be better taken up
by good plants, but it appropriates a large quantity
of food to the prejudice of the better crop.</p>

<p>Viewed in this light, then, what a mass of weeds
some of our pastures will be found to contain! In
fact, what with useless plants, other than grasses, and
coarse, sour, or useless grasses themselves, we meet
with so-called meadows to which the terms of &#8220;barren
moor&#8221; or waste land would be especially applicable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>The following table is offered as an attempt at the
classification of the weeds of pasture, the different
divisions of which we shall presently describe in the
order of their arrangement.</p>

<p>1. Taking the broad-leaved plantain as the type
of this list, we shall have no difficulty in estimating
the amount of mischief which it does. Here is a
plant, a single specimen of which not unfrequently
occupies nearly a square foot of ground, and as its
leaves grow close to the soil, it effectually prevents
the growth of the grass, while few, if any, leaves
are cut with the scythe. The bare patches which
result from the cutting up of plantains from a lawn
will sufficiently establish the first position, whilst, if
one occasionally meets with a few of the leaves cut off
in haymaking, it commits the further mischief of
being so long in drying as to retard the process of
haymaking, or else to endanger the safety of the
rick. It is on account of this that the plantain has
in some districts got the name of the &#8220;Fire Grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>These are easily removed by the spud, especially if
a little salt be added to their crowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>2. Taking it for granted that grasses are for the
most part the best plants for pasturage and hay, it
follows that the plants of this list can only be weeds,
from their taking up space and living at the expense
of the wished-for crop, when, after all, the produce is
either useless, or so inferior that the whole product
of the field is vitiated by their presence. The best
way to eradicate these and other large-leaved and tall-stemmed
plants is to pull them early in the season&#8212;the
true theory being, that by the repeated destruction of
the leaves the rootstock ultimately decays. Close
depasturing also keeps them under for the same
reason, as the feet of horses and cattle so damage the
leaves as to ruin the growth and progress of the
other parts of the plant, which latter are requisite for
its continuance.</p>

<p>3. Added to the evils just adverted to, this group
is injurious from its adverse mechanical appliances
in spinous leaves, stings, and the like. As regards
thistles in pasture, they certainly argue great neglect,
as they may be so readily spudded out, in which the
individual is destroyed, and all hope of its progeny.
It is, however, the fact that these plants are sometimes
left to seed that makes the matter of destruction
appear so hopeless, as the winged seeds of thistles may
even find their way to a clean farm from a dirty one,
and roadsides and waste places are constant sources
of annoyance from this cause.</p>

<p>So fast has the corn thistle increased in Tasmania,
as to make the people groan under a &#8220;plague of
thistles,&#8221; for which they have invoked the aid of
special State legislation.</p>

<p>The spud should be kept in active operation in the
field, so as to prevent these plants seeding, or indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at all occupying any space; and roadsides and waste
places should be freed from these pests, either as part
of the duties of some public servant, or else as a
matter of private necessity.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the fecundity of thistles, we
append the following estimate of their seeding
powers:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<span class="i0">If cut in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reappear very soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in July,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They&#8217;ll hardly die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If cut in August,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die they must.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The truth is, that with spring-time they will bud
forth again, but always in a weakly condition. However,
towards August the thistle has performed all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
functions for the year, and so prepared its larger
rootstocks for the future season; so that he would
not be altogether so mad who, in reference to the
cutting of thistles and nettles in August and September,
should say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Kill a fool&#8217;s head of your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They&#8217;ll die of themselves if you let them alone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beating nettles in the early part of the year with
lithe ash sticks is more effectual than the cleaner cut
with the scythe, as the injuries are not so easily got
over.</p>

<p>4. That there are many plants in pastures which
if eaten exclusively would act as poisons we can have
but little doubt, but there are a few which would
seem to be dangerous, even when partaken of in
grass mixtures. Of these, the meadow saffron is one
of the most powerful.</p>

<p>This plant is abundant on the oolitic rocks of the
Cotteswolds, about which range we constantly hear of
mischief from it. We extract the following from a
Cheltenham paper for September, 1844:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>It is only a few days since a farmer at Eyeford, near Stow-on-the-Wold
(Gloucestershire), had <i>ten calves killed by eating of the flowers
of the colchicum</i>, and two or three years since three cows were
destroyed by this plant in flower in the same neighbourhood, whilst
we frequently hear of many accidents to cattle in the spring from
eating the leaves, although it is sometimes refused by them on
account of its bitter and nauseous taste. Yet there is no doubt
but that accidents would be still more frequent were it not that
farmers keep their cattle from the meadows in which it occurs in
any quantity during the spring and autumn months.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pulling the leaves of the meadow saffron or colchicum
will destroy it; but a much more simple remedy
is that of a thorough rolling with a Croskill at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
season when the flowers begin to expand, and again
when the broad leaves come up in spring; this so
crushes and bruises the whole plant, that a season or
two of such treatment will be enough to keep it under,
if not to destroy it outright.</p>

<p>As regards the buttercups, the most acrid one&#8212;viz.,
the upright tall species, a constant plant in marshy
meadows and wet places&#8212;is the only one to be particular
about. Cattle do not usually eat it, but it finds
its way into the hay, and there is reason to think to
its prejudice. It is to be got under by draining and
close depasturing, so that by treading down it shall
not seed; but poverty, induced by frequent haymaking
and wet, by keeping under the growth of what is
better, gives greater facility for the success of trash
of this as well as of other kinds.</p>

<p>Ergotised grasses, by which we mean those affected
with the black spur, in the place of the seed, or grain,
is a common affection of grasses in autumn in low-lying
or in damp places, or where fields may be
enveloped in mist, as on some of our hill-ranges.
This black spur is largest in the cereal rye, but it
occurs in most other species of grasses, differing
according to the size of their seeds.</p>

<p>Ergot of rye is used medicinally, and there is little
doubt but that ergot in other grasses is equally active.
Its effects seem to be to favour abortion; and there
is reason to believe that it has caused many valuable
animals to abort. Some few years since the late
Earl Ducie suffered a loss of calves to an extent
which he calculated to equal as much as &pound;1,000 in
one year; at that time the grasses, consisting mostly
of the perennial rye-grass, were submitted to our
inspection, and they were much affected by ergot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>Keeping the cattle away from meadows known to
present much of this affected grass is the best remedy;
but this will seldom be necessary, except in unusually
wet and warm seasons, which are sure to produce
these fungoid affections.</p>

<p>5. All the plants in this section are known to
give a garlic-like flavour to the dairy produce of the
fields in which they grow. The two first especially
render butter unfit for market; so that if abundant
they would take off a large portion of the value of
the field. They occur mostly in patches, and should
be pulled out as soon as strong enough: if this be
done year by year, it will be found to diminish in an
increased ratio; and two or three seasons will be
enough to rid the field of so great a pest, and would
be well worth doing if it cost much&#8212;which it ought
not to do&#8212;as these weeds usually occur in otherwise
tolerably good meadows.</p>

<p>The jack-by-the-hedge is usually confined to the
vicinity of the fences, and may be removed by the
hand or spud. It is a prolific seeder; so that on no
account should it ever be allowed to ripen its seed.</p>

<p>6. Rough grasses and grass-like weeds are far too
common in poor, wild, and neglected pastures. In
their action they come closely to those of our second
section; they are indications of a want of drainage,
which operation well performed soon causes the death
of this group, which end is greatly facilitated by
manuring and depasturing as the drains begin to act.</p>

<p>In concluding this description, it may be well to
remark that many more plants might have been
included in the different sections; but enough has
been done to show that a pasture, to be good, must
not consist of any plants which chance, accident, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
more commonly neglect, may throw together. In
arable culture one-half the expense is, in one way
or other, connected with weeding, and we are of
opinion, that if only one shilling per acre was spent on
the weeding of pasture, it would yield 300 per cent.
profit on the outlay.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE IRRIGATED MEADOW.</h4>

<p>Irrigation, as a means of increasing the amount
of pasturage, is so important a process that it
may be well to describe it in this place.</p>

<p>For a perfect irrigated meadow, we should have
full command of water whenever it may be required.
This water should be capable of flowing through, not
of pouring over, and standing on the land,&#8212;this
latter being flooding. The drainage should be so
perfect that the land will be sound enough for us to
walk over in the dry in a few hours after the water
has been turned off.</p>

<p>Where these conditions can be secured, irrigation
will be found most useful, not only in augmenting
the supply of grass, but in producing it so much
earlier than in the higher meadows that the farmer
hereby gets a fresh green pasture, of great utility,
especially in fattening and bringing on early lambs.
From these circumstances it follows, that although
some land is occupied in the water-conduits, yet the
value is so far increased that meadow at 30<i>s.</i> per
acre before irrigation has, under one&#8217;s own eye,
become worth &pound;5 per acre in four years. There are,
however, some necessary expenses in setting out the
work, making floodgates, &amp;c., the extent of which
will of course depend upon the nature of the ground.
In Gloucestershire, on the banks of the Churn, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
irrigation has been successfully carried on for years,
there is a permanent cost of about 6<i>s.</i> an acre for
keeping the works in order, and charges of the
&#8220;drowner,&#8221; the name given to the man who overlooks
the works, in some instances of several proprietors
or tenants.</p>

<p>A peculiarity in irrigated meadow of the best
quality is, the general absence of coarse grasses on
the one hand, and of any plants other than grasses
on the other; hence, then, good succulent and nutritious
herbage is the rule, and anything that can be
otherwise described is the rare exception. Indeed, so
much is this the case, that a bit of coarse grass&#8212;such,
for instance, as <i>Aira c&aelig;spitosa</i> (Tussac Grass)&#8212;making
successful growth in any part of the meadow,
is at once an evidence of a stagnation of water at that
spot&#8212;a condition that a clever drowner at once looks
to when he has discovered it.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the changes which go on as the
process succeeds, as well as of their nature, we give
the following as the tabulated result of the irrigation
of half of a meadow whose slope was too great to
allow of the whole being operated upon. From these
it will be seen that the proportionals of different
pasture plants before and after irrigation offer a
material change; and it may be added, that in some
cases, what would otherwise be a bad and useless
grass, may become succulent and useful from the
beneficial action of water. One of this kind is the
<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i> (Fiorin Grass), which is in arable
couch-grass weed, but in the irrigated meadow it
becomes of a fine green colour, is nutritive in quality,
and will bear with any amount of clipping. It
may here, too, be remarked that in cases where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
only a part of a meadow can be irrigated, good
accrues to the whole, as in depasturing the whole is
ranged over by our cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>We here give the following</p>

</table>

<p>The general conclusions from this table are, that
large and innutritious herbage is, for the most part,
destroyed by irrigation, and its place is supplied by
grasses; hence, then, the increased value conferred
by the regulated action of water is due to an increase
in quantity and quality of the grasses, added to a
much more certain, as well as early, production of
these. Of course the districts best adapted to irrigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
will be valleys of denudation, the centres of
which are occupied by more or less copious and
rapid streamlets. Some of these valleys in the
Cotteswolds having been scooped out of the oolitic
freestones, have left the spoils of the rock as a
gravelly deposit, sometimes on the lias, at others
on the fuller&#8217;s earth, and then on the Oxford clays;
so that, stiff as these soils would be by themselves,
they now only tend to throw out the waters by
natural drainage, which are again conducted over
the porous gravels through which they flow with
great regularity; thus fertilizing what would otherwise
be but a scanty thin-soil herbage, and to such an
extent that early depasturing, haymaking, and later
pasturage (<i>lattermath</i>) are the rule year by year.</p>

<p>These circumstances make water-rights of great
value, and which, if not in possession, are secured at
a fixed charge per acre; this, however, is usually
included in the expenses, which, as before stated,
are covered by about 6<i>s.</i> per acre.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, we must say a
few words in reference to flooded meadows. These
will be found on the banks of the larger rivers or
on streams of sufficient importance to be called rivers,
as distinguished from brooks or streamlets. Here
the flooding is caused by the water overflowing the
banks, as the result of sudden thaws or an unusual
quantity of rain. Here then the flood is not under
control, and as it may happen at any and all times of
the year, the grass may be spoiled by being covered
with silt and drifted materials, or even the hay may
be carried away by the flood.</p>

<p>These river flats, then, have seldom the requisites
for carrying on irrigation, although the waters are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
course more abundant than those supplied by the
smaller streams; for even if we could by embanking
so far control the water as to get it over the field
when we might wish, yet alluvial flats like those of
much of the Thames and Severn would not readily
drain.</p>

<p>From facts like these it will at once be seen that
there is a wide difference between irrigation and
flooding; and we have hence endeavoured to separate
what is too often confounded.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h4>ON THE LAYING DOWN OF PERMANENT PASTURE.</h4>

<p>If we reflect upon the fact that much of the meadow
of Great Britain is ribbed by the ridge and furrow of
former arable culture, we shall conclude that the
laying down of land to permanent pasture is an
ancient no less than a modern process.</p>

<p>Formerly new pastures were made by sowing the
collected seeds from a hayloft, but as in modern
farming no one in his senses would let his grass get
ripe enough for seed before cutting, present practice
necessitates the mixing of such seeds as may be considered
best in suitable quantities for our purpose.
We shall have, then, in this place to consider:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The preparation of the land;<br />

2. The kinds of seed best adapted for different places; and<br />

3. The after-treatment of the new meadow.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>1. The plan usually adopted in a preparation for
grass seeds is that of sowing our mixture with the
barley crop. Now this, in the case of a tenant who
is not sure of his tenure, would obviously recommend
itself; but to a proprietor wanting a quicker and
surer result it offers many objections.</p>

<p>We recommend, after turnips have been fed off
on the land, to make the ground as level as possible,
then harrow and roll smooth with an iron or wooden
roller. Upon this surface our mixture should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
carefully sown; then harrow with very light harrows
just to cover the seed, and roll again.</p>

<p>By this plan you start the seeds in good soil instead
of in that from which you have carried off a crop of
ripened grass, straw, and seed; but besides this, your
grass will get a stronger constitution than when
grown as seedlings amid taller plants, which draw
up the &#8220;seeds,&#8221; and thus make them so weak and
attenuated as scarcely to be able to withstand the
rigour of winter&#8212;a matter of great consequence when
our object is to get a vigorously-growing swarth
quickly.</p>

<p>2. We come now to consider the kinds of seeds
which should be sown; these, though few in number,
will yet vary according to soil and situation.</p>

<p>Our remark that few kinds of grasses are required
in laying down for permanent pasture may surprise
those who have seen the usual prescriptions for this
purpose; but if we start in our selection by leaving
out coarse grasses,&#8212;such, for instance, as <i>Phalaris
canariensis</i> (Reed Canary Grass), for damp meadows;
annual forms, or at least not permanent ones, such
as <i>Lolium Italicum</i> (Italian Rye-grass); and useless
varieties, as <i>Poa nemoralis sempervirens</i>, <i>Phleum
pratense majus</i>, and the like,&#8212;we shall be then confined
to as few species of grass as we shall ever find
will form the best parts of our best meadows.</p>

<p>Now, as regards sowing useless or annual species,
we should recollect that the better they come up the
more mischief they create, as they take up the room
that the more permanent forms should occupy, and
so smother them out. How often have we seen our
friends in ecstasies at the success of their new pasture,
when the smiling face had been suddenly put upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the matter by the quick-growing Italian rye-grass
having taken a possession, which, however, in a year
or two it would most probably yield; and so it has
happened, that while the seedsman has been advertising
a certificate vaunting of success, the pasture is
declining, and the proprietor, looking for the reason
for such a result, either himself concludes, or is led
so to do, that as the seeds came up well, these were
not in fault: it must then be the nature of the soil!</p>

<p>In giving such directions for grass mixtures as
experience would seem to warrant, we confess to a
great deal of diffidence; for as scarcely two cases are
alike, the difficulty is as great as would be that of a
medical man prescribing for his various patients
without seeing them; indeed, to profess to do so in
either case, as a general rule, savours somewhat of
quackery.</p>

<p>The following tables, then, it must be understood,
are only meant to convey some very general notions
as to sorts of grasses and other fodder plants, and
their quantities, which we should employ under the
specified conditions of soil; albeit, even the quantities
should be variable, depending upon the quality of the
seeds, the season, and the climate in which they are
to be sown:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The above positions may so far be considered to
present generic types of land which would be laid
down in permanent pasture in the ordinary course
of farming. Selections for park glades, covert, and
the like, are exceptional, which must be provided
for according to circumstances.</p>

<p>We should advise care in the selection of these
seeds; the newer and fresher they are the better,
as, perhaps, no seeds suffer more from keeping than
do those of the grasses. And we would further add
that, as a rule, we should prefer to procure our
seeds separately and mix them ourselves: for this we
should expect to have more to pay at most houses,
but they will be much better. Of course, in all
such strictures about seeds, we mean them to apply
only to those who are not sufficiently particular to
keep from trade tricks, or who do not observe that
care in selection and mixing that would be necessary
to ensure the fullest amount of success; for, as we
are well aware that seeds, however old or worthless,
are seldom destroyed, we should expect to have some
of them sold to us if we did not look to the character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
position, and judgment of our seedsman on the one
hand, and be prepared to go to such, and so pay a
fair price, on the other.</p>

<p>We will now suppose that the seed has come up
regularly, and so must describe the after-treatment.
In the first year it will be all-important to look after
weeds: should these make their appearance, it will
be well to hoe or spud them out at once before they
can seed, as then the grass will not only have a
better chance, but little provision will be left for
weed-continuance.</p>

<p>In the following winter, say about January, if
the weather will suit, a slight but even dressing
of not over-rotten manure will act as a protection
to the young plants, and provide food for their spring
growth by its gradual decomposition and mixing
with the soil.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of February, or early in
March, bush-harrowing should be employed to break
up and disseminate the manure, and then the roller
should be actively used to consolidate the whole;
and, if the grasses have at all thrown out, the
croskill will prove a most efficient implement. In
the following May we should stock with sheep
just thick enough to prevent any extent of seeding;
and if the next year should show vacant spaces,
which it would be likely to do from failure or wire-worm
(the latter will be less than when corn is
grown), we must re-sow, mixing our seeds with a
little mixed guano and soot.</p>

<p>These, then, are some of the simple rules upon
which to act in growing a permanent pasture; and
the more rigidly they are kept to at first, the sooner
and the more perfect will our meadow assume the
aspect we should desire for permanency.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<h4>ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PERMANENT PASTURES.</h4>

<p>However good our meadows and pastures may be,
it is but natural that we should wish to keep them
in good condition, and, if not so good, our object
should be to improve them.</p>

<p>We have already adverted to weeding as a requisite
in the improvement of meadow; we are equally clear
upon the subject of draining. On both of these points,
however, we have met with opposition. The farmer
who considers that all is hay that he can get together
in a rick, may look more to mass than quality, though
even here we are inclined to think that if we take
hay and pasture together, the more grasses and the
less of rubbish we can get a field to grow, the greater
will be our produce in quantity and quality.</p>

<p>With regard to draining, we are told that it takes
the goodness out of the meadow; but if we have a
meadow on clay&#8212;we will suppose lias or Oxford
clay,&#8212;with only a few inches of a stiff soil at the
surface, we shall find that those few inches are the only
available root ground. Drain, and then we shall soon
see that air will follow the water: this united, air and
water will decompose plant-feeding matter never
before reached.</p>

<p>Now, where the mistake has been made is, that
from this time the herbage gets less and less coarse,
and perhaps in some seasons would not produce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
weight of hay; but what there is both of hay and
grass would be much improved, and would become
capable of carrying better stock.</p>

<p>The following reply<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of Mr. Bailey Denton to some
objectors to draining in Middlesex is, we think, much
to the point on this important subject:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Mr. Denton stated that he had been recently over the estate of
Lord Northwick, near Harrow, in company with the noble lord and
some friends and tenants. On that occasion the question of the
reluctance of hay farmers to drain the land was discussed, and the
farmers said that as they always had a great deal of custom in
London for hay, of whatever quality it was, they did not seek so
much for quality as for quantity, and consequently did not think it
worth while to drain the land for feeding purposes, although they
admitted that draining made the herbage sweeter and better for
cattle. The present system, under which the grass-land of the
Harrow district had been cultivated for many years, alike impoverished
the hay farmers and the land; and he was of opinion that
if drained, the latter would produce grass of a much better quality,
and equally as much in quantity. He thought a good plan would be
to feed off part of the land and put the other into hay.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>If asked what would be our criteria as to the
necessity of draining, we should say stagnant water
at any time.</p>

<p>Plants, however, afford evidence to be depended
upon; as thus take the indications of a few weeds
common to wet meadows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Now, as regards very wet meadows, it is found
that they are seldom if ever manured; for, just as
I was told as regards some of the low lands on the
banks of the Yeo, in Somersetshire, that it did not
pay to manure them; so one might easily imagine
that where the land is full of water, and perhaps of
moist <i>humus</i>, manure would not tend to the increase
of good grass, though it might to that of thistles
and buttercups.</p>

<p>Meadows that are sufficiently sound to yield
tolerable hay are too much worked to this end, and
are, we think, getting poorer. The Cheshire pastures
offer a good example of the effects of greed in this
matter. A century ago we feel sure its grass-producing
powers were far beyond what they are now.
Grass is gone in hay and bones and cheese, but
for generations the farmer has gone on depasturing
to make manure; but as it will be seen, on reflection,
that cattle can only deposit as manure, matter which
they have taken from the field and converted into
manurial substance, they cannot add any new material:
so then this method of restoration must fail
at last. Another restoration employed in this county
was that of using their salt as a top-dressing. This,
as it killed all the coarse grass, and so converted it
into manure, recovered the pasture, by, out of bad
and rough grass, growing good ones; but this too
would fail in time. Hay, the framework of growing
cattle, and cheese, have gone on converting the
phosphates and the bone matted of the soil into their
substances, and it is now found that returning this
in the shape of bones and superphosphates is rapidly
effecting an improvement.</p>

<p>Hence, then, we would recommend less of greed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
haymaking. Do not ripen the grasses too much
before cutting. Don&#8217;t trust to grazing for restoring
the phosphates and other ingredients of the hay, but
bring them in the shape of manure.</p>

<p>Use heavy rollers in spring to smooth and consolidate
the soil; replant the roots thrown out by worms;
mat the turf more thoroughly together; and crush
larger but useless plants.</p>

<p>There is, then, less difference between the cultivation
of pasture and of arable land than would at first
be thought.</p>

<p>Drainage, acts of husbandry, amelioration of soil
by rubbish of all kinds where too tenacious, manuring
them by farmyard dung, or, failing this, such artificial
manures as bones, superphosphates, guano,
nitrates, soot, &amp;c.,&#8212;these are the sheet anchors in the
improvement of our pastures; and by these we
should realize the hope of <i>making two blades of good
grass grow where one did before</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h4>ON THE MANAGEMENT OF LAWNS.</h4>

<p>The homes of our fair country are so much beautified
by our nicely-shaven lawns, which nowhere are so
green and smooth as in &#8220;Merrye Englande,&#8221; that a
few words upon their management can hardly be
out of place in a treatise on grasses; we would,
therefore, direct attention to the following questions
connected with the maintenance of lawns in a good
condition.</p>

<p>1. Lawns should have grasses which combine the
finest possible leaf-growth with a capability of restoring
growth and colour under constant cutting.</p>

<p>2. Lawns should be entirely free from plants
other than grasses, unless we except the Dutch
clover.</p>

<p>3. Lawn grasses should possess the property of
intimately weaving one with the other.</p>

<p>4. After cutting, they should grow as near the
same height as possible.</p>

<div class="figc300"><a name="Fig022bis" id="Fig022bis"></a>
<img src="images/illo081.png" alt="Sheep's Fescue (again)" width="251" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 22</i> (<i>bis</i>). Sheep&#8217;s Fescue.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Fine Lawn Grasses.</i>&#8212;The annexed <a href="#Fig022bis">engraving</a>
(<i>Festuca ovina</i>) represents one of our finest-leaved
grasses; it is one, too, that will even bear the constant
nibbling of sheep without losing either its vitality or
its colour. This, and a larger variety called the <i>F.
duriuscula</i>, are two forms of this genus well adapted
for lawns.</p>

<p>If to these we add the <i>Lolium perenne</i>, <i>Poa pratensis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and <i>Cynosurus cristatus</i>, we shall have nearly all
the useful lawn grasses. As regards <i>Poa pratensis</i>,
we should, however, leave
it out where we have
borders cut in the turf, as
its creeping underground
stems are mischievous,
from their habit of getting
into the borders with the
flowers. This, of course,
would lead us to discourage
any couch-like grass.
If, then, we have plots,
and the soil of the lawn
be sufficiently moist, we
should recommend <i>Poa
trivialis</i> to be sought in
its stead.</p>

<p>Something like uniformity
of colour is desirable;
as, if we see bunches
of the silvery-leaved Soft
Grass, or the brown
patches of the <i>Fiorin</i>, it
is so unsightly that we should feel the necessity of
introducing a new turf where it occurs.</p>

<p>2. <i>Lawn Weeds.</i>&#8212;Plantains, dandelions, and daisies
can only be considered weeds whenever they occur
in grass, but especially in the lawn. They are easily
guarded against, if in laying down turf we only choose
clean specimens, or in laying down seeds we obtain
pure samples, and sow them on well-cleaned ground.
But however careful we may be, we shall be sure of a
few weeds. These can be kept under by cutting them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
out with a knife, taking care to drop a pinch of salt
on the crowns that we leave behind; and then, if
we use a little fine lawn-grass seed to the vacant
places, and well roll after the process, we shall
certainly keep them under. This should be done
in spring, and not in autumn, as we shall then be
more certain of success, upon the principle before
explained.</p>

<p>If, despite all we do, a few crowns still send up
shoots, our mowing must always be frequent enough
to prevent their seeding; and as in the height of
summer, seeding, in the case of all three of the plants,
will take place in a few days, such neglect as our own
lawn once got when we were away for a month&#8217;s
vacation, in not being mowed sufficiently often, may
take years to remedy.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Mixture of Grasses</i> is secured by constant
mowing and rolling, by which means anything like a
wild method of grass-growth is avoided. When,
however, a lawn is left for a long time without such
careful treatment, some of the grasses are sure to
stool out and grow bunchy. In this case, the quickest
way of putting the matter to rights will be to remove
the offending tufts, and introduce new turf, taking
care to keep the whole in order by the scythe and
the roller.</p>

<p>Talking, however, of these implements of lawn-culture
reminds one to remark that with some the
scythe and roller are almost discarded, at least in
summer. Our own lawn is rolled with an iron roller
during the winter and early spring; but when mowing
begins, we prefer the new lawn-mowing machines.
We have now used one of Samuelson&#8217;s for four years,
and it has not cost us a single sixpence for repairs; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
strong boy can use it, and it possesses the advantages
of cutting close and evenly, collecting not only the
cut grass but scattered leaves as it goes, and, withal,
most completely rolling the turf at the same time.
We are, too, not awoke by scythe whetting at four
o&#8217;clock in the morning, to secure the dew upon the
grass, as the dry part of the day is perhaps the best
for the use of the mowing-machine.</p>

<p>There is, then, no excuse for weeds or bunchy
grass with a mowing-machine, as the whole operation,
as here described, is done in less time than
was formerly occupied in the scythe in mowing
alone.</p>

<p>4. <i>Evenness in height</i> is a matter of importance
for the lawn; for if we have grasses together, some of
which make three inches of growth while the majority
are growing but one inch, the whole look uneven
and ugly.</p>

<div class="figc400"><a name="Fig031" id="Fig031"></a>
<img src="images/illo121.png" alt="Taller grasses" width="400" height="251" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 31.</i> The Taller Grasses.</p>
</div>

<p>The annexed cut (<a href="#Fig031">fig. 31</a>) shows the effects of this,
the taller grass being a root of cocksfoot, which is not
only bunchy, but its leaves are too broad for a good
lawn grass, and it grows twice as fast as the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
species (<i><a href="#Fig031">a</a></i>); its colour, too, would be so much lighter
than that of the surrounding herbage as to be at once
visible, and to strike one as a great blemish. Here,
again, the offending patch should be removed, and
better turf introduced, which operation should be
performed in the autumn if possible, so as to have the
full benefit the following summer.</p>

<p>These points in the cultivation of lawns are more
particularly applicable in the process of laying down
lawns with cut turves, which is the usual practice, and
especially when an immediate effect is required. In
this case, then, it cannot be too strongly urged that
much trouble and expense may be saved by choosing
the finest turf for our purpose; and the trouble of
picking out an objectionable grass or weed before
laying down will be amply rewarded.</p>

<p>If it be thought desirable to sow grass seeds to get
a lawn, we would propose the following mixture:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Occasionally there will be bald places in parks, such

would be advisable to provide seed for, that should
have an immediate effect. In this case we should mix
a small quantity of the <i>Poa annua</i> with the above, as
it not only effects the object of making the whole
look green very quickly, but so small a grass scarcely
interferes with the growth of the more permanent

<p>It now only remains to point out that the constant
mowing of lawns, although it only takes away young
grass, must in time have the effect of impoverishing
the lawn. In such case, the grass will not be of so
bright a colour as formerly, and it will become more
or less mixed with moss. In this state of matters the
grasses die, and different species of agarics live upon
the decaying roots.</p>

<p>In this condition we find that colour and fertility are
restored by a good sprinkling of soot, which usually
operates very beneficially for four or five years. After
this period a little guano, say one part to three parts
of soot, will do better. Another method of restoring
fertility is that of an occasional use of house slops,
diluted with five parts of water; this showered evenly
from a watering-pot, engine, or hydropult, usually
has a most beneficial effect.</p>

<p>In concluding this subject of &#8220;How to Grow Good
Grass,&#8221; the author would wish to impress upon his
readers the important fact, that as our country is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
peculiarly adapted for the growth of pasturage, and
as this interesting genus of plants furnishes the best

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD CLOVER.</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE CLOVER
FAMILY OF PLANTS.</h4>

<p>Clovers are admitted by all to be such important
adjuncts to the fodder plants of the farm as to render
a scientific and practical treatise upon them and their
allies a matter not only of interest, but of general
agricultural utility; for, if we except the grasses,
perhaps no natural order of plants is of greater value
to the farmer than that to which the clovers belong;
for, though they differ in every point of their structure,
yet in their farm products they offer an interesting
analogy. Thus, whilst in the Graminaceous plants
we have cereal or corn-seed products, and meadow and
pasture herbs, in the Leguminous plants we have a
seed-producing group termed pulse, and a herb-growing
green-food or fodder series. On either
hand, in both groups, there are differently-cultivated
forms; for, while the grass-cereals are wholly the
result of arable culture, the fodder grasses are for the
most part grown under conditions distinguished by
the farmer as pasture. So of leguminous plants,
pulse, such as peas and beans, belongs exclusively to
the arable part of the farm; but the fodder kinds, as
clover, either mix with the grass of the meadow, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are grown by themselves or with grasses in shifting
green crops: indeed, it is by reason of clovers eking
out grass, or being used as pasturage, that they have
come to be designated &#8220;artificial grasses.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tribe of plants under review forms an exceedingly
natural group, which has been named <i>Papilionace&aelig;</i>,
from the fancied resemblance in the arrangement
of its flowers to the form and varied colouring
of butterflies: by others it is designated <i>Leguminos&aelig;</i>
from the two-valved seed-pod, which by the botanist
is termed a <i>legume</i>,&#8212;most perfect examples of which
are seen in the fruits of our more ordinary pea
and bean.</p>

<p>Though the flowers of the group are infinitely
varied in size and in colour, yet they afford most
permanent characters in their irregular petals, which,
after all, have the same parts in the variously coloured
and showy sweet-pea as in the most minute clover;
so that, once examine the pea or bean, and the significance
of the name of the order depending upon the
flowers, will be easily understood. Again, varied as is
the seed-pod, yet a little examination will show that
its type is simple, there being no structural difference
between the straight legume of the pea and the
spirally-twisted one of the lucerne and medicks, or
the many-seeded smooth pod of the common broom
and the single-seeded wrinkled pod of the sainfoin.</p>

<p>The seeds, again, may vary in colour; some, like those
of the scarlet-runner, are curious as affording an infinite
variety of self-colours for their different sorts, from pure
white to absolute black; or these may be so pencilled
as to make a <i>testa</i> or seed-covering as variously
mottled as are the eggs of some of our birds. Yet,
whether rounded as in the pea, flat as in the bean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
lenticular as in the lentil, or kidney-shaped as in the
clovers, they are all readily referred to one group
by the flat, oval eye (<i>hilum</i> of the botanist), and the
fact of their ready capability of separating into two
valves (<i>cotyledons</i>), so observable in our split peas
and beans.</p>

<p>But of all the varieties in their parts presented by
the pea-flowered tribe of plants,&#8212;if we except the fact
that some are larger trees, as the locust tree, ebony,
laburnum, &amp;c., whilst some are among our smallest
plants, as clovers and medicks,&#8212;the principal differences
will be found in the foliage. The grass
vetchling, for example, is so named from its leaves
being not unlike those of grasses, while the yellow
vetchling, in its mature state, has the whole leaf converted
into a tendril and the appendages at the bases of
the leaves (<i>stipules</i>) are so enlarged as to be often mistaken
for leaves: in another of the vetchlings, the
everlasting sweet-pea, we find that, as so much of the
leaf is converted into tendrils to enable this handsome
plant to climb over the hedges and thickets, the stem
is made four-winged with leaf-matter, to ensure the
due performance of the leaf function. Now parts
called stipules are present in this whole tribe, and,
like all other parts of these plants, they vary in form,
size, and markings, and hence afford important aid in
the discrimination of species. Again, the old furze-bush
will have its leaves converted into spines,
though the seedling started with a trifoliate leaf.
Points like these, however, though most interesting
to the student of vegetable physiology, are beyond
the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>Like every other point connected with this interesting
natural order of plants, their uses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
properties are greatly varied, and perhaps variable.
The Sennas are renowned for their medicinal properties,
being in some kinds aromatic and purgative.
A powerful aroma is given off from the Melilots,
similar to that of the well-known sweet vernal grass
(<i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>), on which account it has
been recommended to mix a little of their seeds with
clovers, or to cultivate separate patches of either the
white or the yellow Melilot to place here and there,
sandwich-wise, in the clover hay-rick.</p>

<p>In speaking of this matter of flavour in food for
cattle, we may here mention that the seed of one of
this order, which is now being extensively employed for
its flavouring principle, is the F&#339;nugr&aelig;c (<i>Trigonella
f&#339;num-gr&aelig;cum</i>), which was formerly used in large
quantities by horse and cattle doctors as an ingredient
in drenches or drinks for horses, cows, and pigs.
Latterly, however, it has been still more largely
employed as a flavouring matter in the different kinds
of &#8220;Cattle Feeds.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> We have cultivated these seeds in England, and found them to
ripen very well, and if the flavouring of food be correct in principle,
the seeds might readily be ground with feeding stuffs, while the dried
plant could be mixed with hay and straw in chaff.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, whether medicinal properties reside as a rule
in all of the order, it would perhaps be difficult to
determine; but, as we sometimes find that certain
clover crops are accused of causing &#8220;scouring,&#8221; there
is perhaps reason to conclude this, but that its
amount varies according to season, soil, and cultivation.</p>

<p>1. <i>Trifolium pratense</i>&#8212;Meadow or broad-leaved
Clover,&#8212;in its wild state, is too well known to need any
lengthened description in order to its being understood.
A careful examination of field specimens,
however, will show that, even in the wild state, this
plant is liable to run into numberless variations; thus,
we may have the leaflets of one plant more or less ovate,
whilst those of another may be broad and almost
obcordate. In some we may see dense heads of
purple flowers, varying in shade until almost white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
whilst less dense heads of flowers and general variations
in height, size, and luxuriance of the whole
plant, are all circumstances in the natural history of
this species in the wild state which will prepare us
duly to understand the nature of the many forms of
the plant which are found in cultivation. Of these
we have, besides others, English, French, American,
and Dutch sorts, which differ in such minor details,
as a greater or lesser hairiness, or variations in the
colour and size of the flowers, leaves, &amp;c. The most
important point connected with the broad-leaved
clover is its permanency; some sorts scarcely maintaining
a plant for two years, whilst others are said
to be more or less perennial. This, however, is a
matter which we conceive depends more upon the
soil and the kind of cultivation than upon the sort;
for, although all seedsmen supply two sorts, namely,
<i>Trifolium pratense</i> and <i>Trifolium pratense perenne</i>,
yet they run so much the one into the other, that
it is oftentimes exceedingly difficult to distinguish
them.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may see the differences
and agreements of the three sorts,&#8212;1, <i>Trifolium pratense</i>
(of the meadow); 2, <i>Trifolium pratense</i> (the
arable plant); and 3, <i>Trifolium pratense perenne</i>
(also of the arable),&#8212;we give their characters in
parallel columns, on <a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>.</p>

<p>Now, although the study of the characters, as here
laid down with the specimens in our hand, may
render it tolerably easy to distinguish the three forms
here described, yet it must be confessed that whether
we examine a series of the wilder plants from different
positions, or different samples of the cultivated broad-leaved
clovers, we shall find great variations; the
principal of these will be discussed in another chapter:
we may here, then, for the present leave this
difficult subject of how to distinguish cow-grass and
broad-leaved or red clover, with the observation that
the common red clover is uniformly in flower two or
three weeks before the other.</p>

<p>2. <i>Trifolium medium</i> (see <a href="#ZigZag">Plate</a>)&#8212;Zigzag Trefoil&#8212;gets
its English name from the peculiar bends in its
stem, which being at alternate sides, make up the zigzag
outline. The stems are rounded&#8212;not channelled,&#8212;mostly
of a purple colour, and clothed with short
hairs. The leaves are smooth, with elliptical&#8212;not
emarginate&#8212;leaflets, sometimes, but seldom, with the
white lunulate spot. The calyx is smooth. The
heads of flowers are solitary, on very short footstalks;
they are of a bright pinkish red hue, and not of the
lilac colour of the common clover.</p>

<div class="figc400"><a name="ZigZag" id="ZigZag"></a>
<img src="images/illo135.png" alt="Zigzag trefoil" width="354" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Trifolium medium.<span class="padl3">Zigzag Trefoil.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In its wild state the zigzag clover will be found in
districts remarkable for the absence of lime, such as
the sandstones. In the sandy deposits accompanying
the coal in Wales, as also in Staffordshire, this is the
prevailing form of clover. Hence, then, this species
seemed to recommend itself for sandy lands, in which
the common clover does not so well succeed; and we
conceive that, as a consequence, it was brought into
cultivation for this capability of &#8220;holding on&#8221; to such
soils, which, if they will not grow the other kind, is
considered clover sick. We have reason to think that
the <i>T. medium</i> and <i>T. pratense</i> are not distinct
species, but that the difference in their usual
habitats has determined their difference in form,
and we think that the <i>T. pratense perenne</i> of the
seedsman is a form intermediate between the two:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
if so the position of the three may be expressed
as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="padr6"><i>Trifolium pratense.</i></span><span class="padl6"><i>Trifolium medium.</i></span><br />
<i>Trifolium pratense perenne.</i></p>

<p>At all events, if this plant was ever distinct in
cultivation, it has merged into broad clover forms; so
that, if we are to possess it as a separate plant, it
must again be grown from wild seed, and then, if it
is to be kept pure, it must not be cultivated on clays
or limestone, or, if our view be correct, it will soon
lose its true distinctive characters.</p>

<p>3. <i>Trifolium incarnatum</i>&#8212;Annual Carnation or
Crimson Clover&#8212;is a large species with oblong heads
of flowers of a fine carnation colour, hence its common
name of &#8220;Carnation Clover.&#8221; It is a native of
Southern Europe, and is said to have been found wild
at the Lizard, in Cornwall. As a cultivated plant, it
has not long been introduced into England, where it
has been much grown in the southern counties, as
there it can be sown soon enough on the wheat
stubbles with only just a simple harrowing-in, when
it has time to make a plant sufficiently strong to
resist winter; this soon makes growth in the spring,
giving an early feed, or it may be mown; in either
case it is off the land sufficiently early to allow of a
late sowing of turnips: so that, where the climate will
allow of it, we may snatch an intermediate crop by
means of the carnation clover. It yields a large
crop, but its feeding qualities, according to Dr.
Voelcker, are somewhat inferior to those of the
broad-leaved clover. It should be noted that varieties
having white flowers are in the market, and of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
red and white there are earlier and later sorts which
may be useful for succession.</p>

<p>4. <i>Trifolium hybridum</i>&#8212;Alsike Clover&#8212;has, perhaps,
got its specific name from possessing appearances
and qualities intermediate between the broad-leaf
and the Dutch clovers. This species has been
introduced from Sweden, and its growth, duration, and
feeding qualities certainly entitle it to rank high, and
more especially for growth on some of the stronger
soils. In our experience we have not found it to
possess such eminent perennial habits as have been
claimed for it. It thins very much after the second
year, and almost disappears in three years, unless it
be renovated by being allowed to seed, when the new
plants by no means attain to the vigour of their
parents.</p>

<p>5. <i>Trifolium fragiferum</i>&#8212;Strawberry-headed Clover&#8212;has
been named from the strawberry-like form which
its head, of enlarged coloured calyxes, assumes after
flowering; its flowers are pinkish, but otherwise of
much the same size and form as those of the Dutch
clover, which latter it again approaches in its creeping
habit and form of its foliage. It is, however, here
mentioned only to point out the difference of its
habits and indications when compared with the
Dutch or white clover. The strawberry trefoil is a
native of cold wet pastures, such as bear the name of
&#8220;hungry clays;&#8221; when present in quantity it is not
to be confounded with Dutch clover, which would
indicate a sound fertile soil.</p>

<p>6. <i>Trifolium repens</i>&#8212;White Dutch Clover&#8212;is a
plant of very general cultivation, both at home and in
the States, and in both of which quarters of the globe
it maintains its character with great constancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Dutch clover is a valuable pasture plant either
in meadows or in seeds. In the former it is much
increased by the addition of nitrates, soot, &amp;c., with
guano or superphosphate. As a plant, in seed mixtures,
it is usually sown with other trifoliate plants
and rye grasses, but if the soil be very light the
Dutch clover may be increased or wholly used.</p>

<p>7. <i>Trifolium filiforme</i>&#8212;Small Yellow Clover&#8212;is one
of the least of our small yellow-flowered division.
It is a common native species occurring on the waysides,
and has been brought into cultivation to only a
limited extent, under the impression that its small
herbage is suitable as a first bite for young stock, and
hence the term &#8220;suckling clover&#8221; has been applied
to it. It is of little value, and does not seem capable
of being greatly improved. This species is often
mistaken for the following, even by pretended botanists,
but its lax head of smaller flowers will well
distinguish it.</p>

<p><a name="Sec_Procumbens" id="Sec_Procumbens"></a>8. <i>Trifolium procumbens</i> is called by the botanist
&#8220;Hop Trefoil,&#8221; from the fact that its dried head of
persistent flowers<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> exactly resembles small bunches of
hop <i>strobiles</i> (fruiting heads). The foliage is much
like that of <i>Medicago lupulina</i>, nonsuch, or black
medick, which is the &#8220;hop&#8221; of the farmer; but the
whole plant of the true hop trefoil dries up so quickly
under the sunshine, and is withal so wanting in
succulency and quality, that it cannot be compared
with <i>M. lupulina</i> as a fodder plant, and hence it is
but little cultivated in the present day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Flowers are so called that remain enveloping the seed while it
ripens, which they do in all the clovers.</p></div>

<p>There are other clovers which have been recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for cultivation, but they are mostly foreign,
and do not appear to possess those qualities which
should lead us to prefer them before those in
common use. There are, too, several additional wild
clovers, but they possess no agricultural interest,
unless, perhaps, as indicators of soil. The <i>Trifolium
pratense</i> (Hare&#8217;s-foot Trefoil) is a pretty, wild species,
native to light sandy soils, the seed of which is sold
for growing &#8220;bedding plants.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<h4>ON THE VARIETIES OF RED CLOVERS.</h4>

<p>The <i>Trifolium pratense</i> of botanical authors is
remarkable for the great number of varieties it
assumes, even in its wild growth; but these are
exceeded in the number of cultivated forms: thus
in any rich meadow we may make out several sorts
which may be expected to be more or less permanent,
whilst the market samples of seed will offer us several
varieties for the different countries of America,
England, France, Holland, Germany, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following are some of the more prominent of
our native wild varieties:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>1. <i>Trifolium pratense</i>&#8212;Common Red Clover.&#8212;Head of pink;
flowers, somewhat compact; leaves more or less broad; plant smooth<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
in proportion to its size, the smaller wild specimens being usually very
hairy; stem more or less purple.<br />
2. <i>Trifolium pratense</i>, var. <i>pallidum</i>&#8212;Pale-flowered Clover.&#8212;Head
of very light pink; flowers large, full, and more rotund than 1, and
almost double in size and in the number of its flowers; whole plant
more or less hairy; stem green.<br />
3. <i>Trifolium pratense</i>, var. <i>album</i>&#8212;White Clover.&#8212;Flowers white;
herbage a very light green; in other respects much the same as
the last.<br />
4. <i>Trifolium pratense perenne</i>&#8212;Perennial Red Clover.&#8212;Flowers
less compact than the common clover, whole plant having stems
inclining to dark purple; leaves narrower.<br />
<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>5. <i>Trifolium pratense perenne</i>, sub-var. <i>pallidum</i>&#8212;Pale Perennial
Clover.&#8212;A larger plant than the parent form, and less hairy.<br />
6. <i>Trifolium pratense perenne</i>, sub-var. <i>album</i>&#8212;White Perennial
Clover.&#8212;Not common, but still, like 3, an albino form, and is, perhaps,
more delicate in constitution than the coloured sorts.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In this, as well as the generality of forms, the smoother and
larger growth indicates cultivation, manuring will sometimes make
the difference.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, it appears to us that the descendants of the two
types, <i>Trifolium pratense</i> and <i>T. medium</i> (see <a href="#ZigZag">Plate</a>)
form the basis of the red or broad-leaved clover on
the one hand, and the perennial or cow-grass clover
on the other; whilst the market varieties have,
perhaps, been modified by climate, soil, and probably
hybridization with other sorts. It may, indeed, be
that, after all, the plants described in <a href="#Page_109">chapter XVII.</a>
as two distinct species are only varieties, for though
the common form of <i>T. pratense</i> grows everywhere
on mixed soils, the more sandy positions, as the sandstones
connected with the coal in South Wales, offer
a greater abundance of the <i>T. medium</i>; and, from
experiments conducted with seed of this latter
obtained from near Swansea, Glamorgan, and sown
on forest marble clay of the Cotteswolds, we certainly
obtained plants differing very much from the
typical form of <i>T. medium</i>, and assuming the usual
broad-leaved clover variations.</p>

<p>Here, then, is opened up a curious subject for
inquiry, which the history of the seed trade as it
relates to clover-seed may tend in some measure
to elucidate. Some few years ago <i>T. pratense</i> and
<i>T. medium</i> were advertised as on sale by most
seedsmen; in fact, the latter was the name by which
what is now called cow-grass clover was known.
Now, however, it is doubtful if any seedsman would
pretend to send out the <i>T. medium</i>; but the label
<i>T. pratense perenne</i> has been substituted for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Sinclair&#8217;s figure of &#8220;Trifolium medium, marl-clover,
cow-grass,&#8221; in the &#8220;Hortus Gramineus
Woburnensis,&#8221; facing page 141, is scarcely a true
form of the plant, as its more or less emarginate
leaflets incline to the form of <i>T. pratense</i>; and yet,
at the time this author wrote, even this was doubtful.
<i>T. medium</i> was difficult to obtain, as he says, &#8220;All the
seeds and plants I have had for this (except that
from Messrs. Gibbs &amp; Co., which proved to be the
present plant&#8212;<i>T. medium</i> of Sinclair) have turned
out only two-year lived plants, or never exceeding
three, though cultivated on various soils.&#8221; We have
repeatedly written for seed, and ten years ago were
always supplied with samples so labelled; but in no
case did we get it. Latterly seedsmen honestly confess
that they have not the seed, but can send
<i>T. pratense perenne</i>.</p>

<p>Now, that this latter is merely a variety of the
broad-leaved clover there can be but little doubt;
still the fact that it is usually more perennial in its
habit is of importance. We may easily understand
why it should be so, if we consider that the common
broad-leaved clover in its cultivation is so much
earlier than the cow-grass form, so that this enables
two cuttings of the former to be made in one season,
two crops of hay being taken very commonly indeed;
and as the plant gets well in flower before it is cut
the first time, and seed is saved from the second crop,
a more exhaustive plan for the crop itself or its future
perennial powers could hardly be brought about.
The cow-grass clover, however, is a fortnight and
more later, which renders it difficult to cut two crops;
and so its method of growth is not so exhaustive.
We know that the common wild clover is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
last only two years, but with constant depasturing
we see no reason why the same roots should not send
up herbage for five or even ten years.</p>

<p>However theoretical such inquiries may be deemed,
yet it must be confessed that they are of great practical
importance; for, if a plant has a tendency to
run into varieties, it makes it daily more difficult to
get its seed true to sort; and if we are liable to have
a sample, part of which may be less hardy or part
more tardy in its development, it follows that much
of it may never arrive at maturity, whilst if it does,
as the crop will be uneven, it can never be reckoned
upon for so good a yield.</p>

<p>Much of the variable nature of the sorts which we
observe in a clover-field may be the result of the
mixing of seeds from different and distant localities:
if so, it is much to be regretted. But this only tends
to show us how important it is that seed should be
grown with care, to which end, as regards clover-seed,
we sadly want some well-conducted experiments
on different varieties, especially of a wild native plant,
with a view to obtain a sample with good, permanent,
and even qualities. In fact, the question of true of
sort is altogether different from that of purity of
sample; but that very serious mischief arises from
the want of the latter will be discussed in another
chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<h4>ON THE CLOVER ALLIES.</h4>

<p>Besides the clovers proper, there are many native
plants of the same natural order that have been found
useful as fodder: these it is now proposed to comment
upon, premising that as we have had them all under
cultivation, we are enabled to discuss their merits
from a practical point of view.</p>

<p>Of these, the following is a list of the genera:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Ulex.</span>&#8212;A spinous shrub.<br />

II. <span class="smcap">Anthyllis.</span>&#8212;Flowers in a dense head, with
white expanded calyces.<br />

III. <span class="smcap">Lotus.</span>&#8212;Flowers in lax heads; pod straight,
many-seeded.<br />

IV. <span class="smcap">Medicago.</span>&#8212;Flowers various; pod spirally
twisted.<br />

V. <span class="smcap">Melilotus.</span>&#8212;Flowers in spikes, drooping to
one side; pod straight, few-seeded.<br />

VI. <span class="smcap">Onobrychis.</span>&#8212;Flowers in spikes, drooping;
pod wrinkled, one-seeded.<br />

VII. <span class="smcap">Vicia.</span>&#8212;Flowers single or spicate in the axils
of the leaves; pod straight, many-seeded.<br />

VIII. <span class="smcap">Lathyrus.</span>&#8212;Flowers one or many on long
footstalks.</p>

</blockquote>

<h5>I. <span class="smcap">Ulex</span>&#8212;<i>Furze</i>.</h5>

<p>A genus of shrubby, spinous, pea-flowered plants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
by far too common on our sandy heaths and wild
hilly places, with varieties occupying wet commons.</p>

<p>We possess, according to authors, some two or
three native species; but we incline to the belief that
they are only varieties of the common <i>U. Europ&aelig;us</i>,
of which these seem to be large and dwarf forms.
This plant, under the name of furze or gorse, has
been from time to time highly extolled as a fodder
plant, and machines have been invented for bruising
its complicated spines; but although it will doubtless
grow where scarcely anything else can be got to
succeed, yet, taking into consideration the expense
attendant upon its growth and utilization, and the
low feeding powers which it possesses, we cannot at
all agree in recommending its general use. It is,
however, but right here to say that articles are from
time to time inserted in such journals as the <i>Agricultural
Gazette</i>, the authors of which advocate the
growth of furze as an agricultural plant, and highly
extol its feeding qualities; still, as our own experience
would lead us to conclude that as even young stock
scarcely hold their own upon this plant, we cannot
recommend it as possessing very valuable properties.</p>

<h5>II. <span class="smcap">Anthyllis</span>&#8212;<i>Ladies&#8217; Fingers</i>.</h5>

<p>The <i>Anthyllis vulneraria</i> is well distinguished in
its young state from its sometimes entire lancet-shaped,
at others pinnate leaves, growing close to the
ground. These are usually clothed with long hairs,
and it has expanded downy calyces, when full grown.
In its young condition it has been very much extolled
for sheep pasturage, while its hay is said to be
abundant and nutritious, though grown on the very
poorest of soils. That it will grow more upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
where sown, one plant drawing up another, we know
from experience, but we have little faith in any
very superior qualities being found in plants that can
grow so well under extremely poor conditions of soil;
still it is just possible that its herbage may improve
in quantity and quality by liberal treatment; yet we
must conclude that, as we already possess much better
plants for growing on better soils, we do not think
much can be gained by its cultivation.</p>

<p>As a plant for hay it will yield a good cut, but its
extreme hairyness and general want of what the
farmer calls &#8220;proof&#8221; will never allow this plant to be
extensively grown.</p>

<h5>III. <span class="smcap">Lotus</span>&#8212;<i>Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil</i>.</h5>

<p>This plant is well known by its loosely-packed
heads of bright yellow flowers, which are succeeded
by long slender pods, dark-coloured or even black
when ripe, and not inaptly likened to a crow&#8217;s foot;
and hence the name &#8220;Crowsfoot&#8221; which it commonly
bears. We have three species, as follow:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Lotus corniculatus</i>&#8212;Common Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil&#8212;is
common, especially in dry meadows, in which its
herbage is duly appreciated by sheep and cattle, if one
may judge from the pertinacity with which it is kept
down. It is no bad adjunct to the rick. We are so
convinced of its value as always to recommend its
use in the laying down of light land for permanent
pasture, and a little seed sown in old meadows
after a dressing of rubbish&#8212;old mortar, town refuse,
&amp;c.&#8212;will tend greatly to the improvement of the
herbage.</p>

<p>2. <i>Lotus tenuis</i>&#8212;Slender-leaved Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil&#8212;is,
perhaps, only a variety of the former; it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
however, smaller in all its parts, and, though a denizen
of stiff soils, occurs chiefly in a wild state on the
margins of fields and on hedge-banks. It might be
employed under the same circumstances as the <i>L.
corniculatus</i>, especially in thin clay-beds on upland
brashes; but it hardly possesses such good qualities.</p>

<p>3. <i>Lotus major</i>&#8212;Larger Bird&#8217;s-foot Trefoil&#8212;is
much larger in all its parts than the other species.
It occurs in moist situations, about bushes in wet
land, in ditches, watercourses, and damp places
generally. We have experimented upon the growth
of this plant in artificial meadows, and from the size
which it attains quite early in summer, and the
quantity of wholesome keep it is capable of affording,
we are disposed to think well of it as an occasional
shifting crop, or it might be well combined with rye-grass
in deep stiff soils.</p>

<h5>IV. <span class="smcap">Medicago</span>&#8212;<i>Medick, &amp;c.</i></h5>

<p>This genus is principally distinguished from <i>Trifolium</i>
by its twisted seed-pods, which in the <i>Medicago
maculata</i> (Spotted-leaved Medick) form quite a spiral
coil, ornamented with a double fringe of stiff spines.
This plant is now becoming general as an agrarian
weed, having been greatly spread, owing to its intermixture
with foreign seeds of different kinds.</p>

<p>The agricultural species are:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><i>Medicago lupulina</i>&#8212;Yellow Sickle Medick.&#8212;&#8220;Hop
trefoil&#8221; of the farmer, but not of the botanist, who
gives this name to the <i>Trifolium procumbens</i> (which
<a href="#Sec_Procumbens">see</a>). From this latter the medick is easily distinguished
by its heads of naked, blackened, incurved
seed-vessels. As an agricultural plant it is of great
value, especially in mixtures called &#8220;seeds.&#8221; It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
good adjunct to rye-grasses and common clovers,
especially on light soils; but on good strong land
which will bear a full crop of broad-leaved clover it
would be mostly smothered out, and, if not, as we
think it is properly held to be less nutritious than
clover, its use is not recommended where first-rate
clover crops can be grown.</p>

<p>We have seen this trefoil grown with sainfoin to
great advantage, as it yields a tolerable crop for the
first two years, and then declines, just as the sainfoin
has got possession of the soil.</p>

<p>2. <i>Medicago sativa</i>&#8212;Lucerne&#8212;is a perfectly perennial
plant, which, though not so much grown
in England as it deserves, yet scarcely needs description;
however, its purple flowers and smooth twisted
seed-pods serve to distinguish it from the rest of the
genus. We have grown this plant upwards of a foot
high by the 1st of May, and taken no less than three
cuttings of a good succulent herbage in one season.
These qualities point out lucerne as an excellent
green-food plant, for which purpose we should always,
where practicable, recommend that at least a patch
should be grown near the stable, as there is reason to
believe that its alterative effects upon the horses are
of a most salutary kind. It should be cultivated in
drills of from 15 to 18 inches apart; and, if properly
weeded and not let get too old before cutting, it will
last for many years with an occasional dressing of
manure.</p>

<p>We once had a patch one half of which was purposely
neglected by way of comparison with the other
half, which was well cared for; that portion left to
itself yielded but poor crops, and almost disappeared
at the end of four years, whilst the other portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
scarcely began to decline after ten years. This remark
applies with full force to all the green-food crops of
this order. Weeding early, mowing when cut, and
an occasional top-dressing, would increase the durability
of all the perennial species.</p>

<h5>V. <span class="smcap">Melilotus</span>&#8212;<i>Melilot</i>.</h5>

<p>These are pea-flowered plants, with ternate leaves,
and spikes of flowers drooping to one side: it is named
from <i>mel</i>, honey, in allusion to its flavour, and the
genus <i>Lotus</i>, by which we may understand it to be
a sweet-scented lotus-like plant. We have two native
species, distinguished thus:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><i>Melilotus officinalis</i>, an annual, with yellow flowers.</p>

<p><i>M. leucantha</i>, a biennial, with white flowers.</p>

<p>Of these we may conclude that the flavour, which
is like that of the <i>Anthoxanthum odoratum</i>&#8212;sweet
vernal grass&#8212;is too strong and bitter to allow of its
being recommended for culture alone; but we are
inclined to think that, if grown in small quantity
with seeds, or if a separate patch be cut and arranged
sandwich-wise in the seed-rick, the melilots would
give that sweet flavour which seems to be the principal
cause of the superior qualities and sweetness of
natural meadow as compared with artificial grasses.</p>

<p>Seeds have been forwarded to us of what is named
&#8220;Cabool Clover,&#8221; and another packet labelled &#8220;Bokhara
Clover,&#8221; both of which appear to belong to the
<i>M. leucantha</i>, though certainly of a larger form than
our native species, and probably consisting of the
<i>M. leucantha major</i>. This latter must be cut young
if used as recommended, as it soon gets woody. A
correspondent of the Royal Agricultural Society has
recently recommended the full-grown plant for paper-making;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and, if of value for this purpose, we can
affirm from experience that a large yield can be got
from soils of a very inferior quality, as our experiments
on its growth have been made on a very stiff and
poor bed of forest marble clay.</p>

<h5>VI. <span class="smcap">Onobrychis</span>&#8212;<i>Sainfoin</i>.</h5>

<p>Sainfoin, or &#8220;holy fodder&#8221; of the French, is distinguished
by its brilliant spike of pink variegated
flowers, which droop to one side, its winged leaves of
from six to eight pairs of oval leaflets, which are
entire, that is, undivided at the margin, and its
short, rounded, wrinkled, and spinose seed-vessels.
The forms in cultivation are<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><i>Onobrychis sativa</i>&#8212;Common Sainfoin. <i>Onobrychis
sativa</i>, var. <i>bifera</i>&#8212;Giant Sainfoin. Of these the
former has the preference in England, whilst the
latter is much grown in France. Our experiments
with both lead us to conclude, that although the
former flowers but once and the latter twice in the
season, the <i>O. sativa</i> still gives the greatest amount
of food, as the second crop of the giant sort is usually
poor and straggling, with but little leaf; while the
common sort sends up a thick growth of leaves after
being cut.</p>

<p>The <i>O. sativa bifera</i> is but a variety of the <i>O. sativa</i>,
as by long continuance of growth from the same
seed in this country it reverts to the common form;
and hence the giant sort should be frequently renewed
from an imported stock. Sainfoin has been much
cultivated on calcareous soils, more especially on the
free-stones of the oolite rocks, and on the chalk, off
which formations it is scarcely known, except on some
calcareous sands in the eastern counties. In the limestone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and chalk districts sainfoin is grown as a permanent
crop, and formerly lasted six or eight years.
In the eastern counties the little there grown is by
way of a shifting crop, in the same place and manner
as common clover. The permanency of sainfoin is
yearly becoming greatly diminished from the circumstance
that its seed is so much mixed with that of the
burnet, <i>Poterium sanguisorba</i>, var. <i>muricata</i>. To such
an extent does this evil occur, that we have examined
samples of sainfoin seed in which there were at the
rate of from twenty to forty thousand of burnet seed-pods
per bushel; and when we consider that these
pods have for the most part two ripened seeds, and
those of a plant growing so much more rapidly than
the sainfoin, we can form some notion how the
desired crop is soon smothered and overpowered by
the burnet, which at best is but a rank weed, of no
agricultural value; for whatever of good there may
be in our ordinary native salad burnet, which is a
smaller and more succulent plant, this sticky foreign
interloper cannot possibly have any claim to our
regard.</p>

<p>The reason why it has gone on so long unchallenged
is that the burnet-seed, though of an entirely
different shape from the sainfoin, is somewhat of the
same colour; and then in their growth both plants have
winged leaves, and the difference between the entire
leaflets of the sainfoin and the toothed leaflets of the
burnet did not at first strike the farmer; now, however,
the difference is better understood, and farmers begin
to require that the burnet-seed shall be sifted from
the sainfoin. This of course will demand the payment
of a better price for the better sample, as in the
process of sifting many of the smaller sainfoin seeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
go through with the burnet; but this will be well
worth a better price, as the larger seeds will undoubtedly
tend to produce a better crop.</p>

<p>If, however, there should be any doubt about pure
sainfoin seed, we should recommend the decorticated
seed being used, as in it the burnet could not possibly
escape detection.</p>

<p>As the history of burnet is so important in connection
with the sainfoin crop, it cannot be out of
place to introduce the following description of this
weed:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The <i>Sanguisorba officinalis</i> (false burnet), as a wild
plant, never attains any great size, and as it is a
denizen of dry calcareous pastures and broken ground
on limestones, and perfectly harmless in its properties
in this condition, it is scarcely noticeable as a weed;
indeed, it is sometimes recommended for permanent
pasture admixture on calcareous uplands. There is,
however, a larger form of the false burnet, which is
now attracting considerable attention, as being by far
too constant an attendant upon sainfoin seed.</p>

<p>This plant is referred by Professor Babington and
the Continental botanists to another species, viz., <i>Poterium
muricatum</i>, which is by them distinguished from
the <i>P. sanguisorba</i>; but is &#8220;usually larger in all its
parts&#8221; (Bab.), with a larger and more decidedly four-winged
fruit. We, however, agree with Bentham in
considering this to be a variety only, and, in fact, an
agrarian form, induced by its seed being gathered
with a crop and treated as a crop plant, so that its
larger form may be easily accounted for; and we are
not wanting in evidence to show that, under cultivation,
the <i>P. sanguisorba</i> greatly increases in size,
while, if left to grow wild, the cultivated form relapses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
into the wilder state. But we incline to think that
the agrarian burnet has got into agriculture by being
introduced with foreign seeds; and as its introduction
seems to have been small at first, it attracted but
little notice; for as the leaves both of the burnet and
sainfoin were pinnate, the difference that the botanist
would observe in the leaflets, <i>i.e.</i> the former being
serrate, and those of the latter having an entire
margin, would hardly attract the attention of the
farmer; however, it soon became so serious a matter
that some crops of so-called sainfoin, in their second
or third year, presented as much as 90 per cent. of
burnet, and as the latter grew taller than the sainfoin,
it effectually smothered it out, and in its place
supplied a sticky, non-succulent, and innutritious
herbage, that made farmers begin to inquire seriously
about the seed.</p>

<p>Here, however, as the seeds, or rather the fruits,
of both plants were pretty much of the same colour,
and both wrinkled, samples of fully half burnet
passed muster in the seed-market; and, though these
fruits are so different in shape and size, yet we were
astonished to find that, during the trial of an action
against a seedsman for supplying sainfoin seed containing
a large quantity of burnet when good sainfoin
seed was paid for, the judge, jury, and most of the
farmers present confessed their inability to distinguish
them; it becomes, therefore, at this point, a duty to
describe the two.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig032">Fig. 32 <i>a</i></a> represents a
short wrinkled pea-pod,
broad at the back and thin
in front, as seen in the section <i><a href="#Fig032">b</a></i>. In the interior is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
single pulse-seed, which is easily freed from its
wrinkled shell.</p>

<img src="images/illo155.png" alt="False burnet seed" width="300" height="208" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 33.</i></p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig033">Fig. 33 <i>a</i></a> is a drawing of a fruit
of false burnet. The section <i><a href="#Fig033">b</a></i> shows
it to be quadrangular, with a wing
at each angle, and to possess two
seeds in each capsule. The capsules
are rather muricated (<i>i.e.</i>
furnished with short excrescences, and not regularly
wrinkled, like the sainfoin). Now the burnet is easily
separable from a sample of sainfoin, as the former
readily passes through the sieve; but the objection
to sift it may be well understood when the bulk is
diminished by the amount of the burnet, and also
that of the smaller sainfoin seeds, which pass through
at the same time.</p>

<p>The best plan, then, to pursue is to mill the sainfoin
seed, in which case its outer covering is removed,
and you simply have a sample of kidney-shaped pure
seed-like enlarged clover-seeds, in which the burnet
may be detected, because it will not mill, but simply
gets its wings broken off, so that the wrinkled two-seeded
capsule still remains.</p>

<p>Now the fact of the burnet being a two-seeded
capsule is most important to be noticed, as, from
analyses we have made of dirty sainfoin crops, we
have estimated as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

surely much more than could be accounted for from
the number of capsules, at least we will hope so; but
when we consider that the capsule of the sainfoin is
<i>single-seeded</i> and that of the burnet is <i>two-seeded</i>, we
may readily conceive how each capsule of the latter may
at least grow a single seed, but the best sample of the
former could hardly be expected to all come up. Now,
as we have as many as 64,000 capsules of burnet
in a bushel of sainfoin seed, that &times; 2 = 128,000
seeds, and when we consider that the burnet grows
so much faster than the sainfoin, we have two elements
for the success of the former, namely, the certainty
of getting its crop, and the equal certainty of
smothering out a large proportional of what may
germinate of the seeds of the sainfoin.</p>

<p>This matter would not be of such importance if the
burnet was equal in point of feeding properties, but
it is not so, for whatever quality be in the smaller
and more succulent <i>P. sanguisorba</i> form, the <i>P. muricatum</i>
is, on the contrary, hard and woody, and almost
useless.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<h4>ON CLOVER SICKNESS.</h4>

<p>In considering the important question involved in
the term &#8220;Clover sickness,&#8221; we would first direct
attention to the fact that crop clover is a derivative
plant which has been so <i>forced</i> that it is many times
larger and more juicy and succulent than the wild
plant from which it sprung. This <i>derived</i> nature
(the propensity, as it were, for fattening) can only be
maintained by a continuance from one generation to
another of those luxuries to which the cultivated
family has been accustomed; hence, then, if seed be
brought from a richer soil to a poorer, or from a
warmer to a colder climate, we may expect that its
plants grown amid barley and drawn up during the
summer would have but a poor constitution to withstand
the rigours of winter; but can we in such a
case say that the <i>land</i> is clover-sick, that is, sick of
growing clover?</p>

<p>Of course the seed here supposed will grow better
in one place than in another, as, for example, we
have traced some American seed of broad-leaved
clover grown by itself in a deep rich soil in the Vale
of Gloucester, where the climate is so much milder
as to be a fortnight before the elevated land of the
Cotteswold Hills and producing an abundant crop;
while the same forming part of a mixture of &#8220;seeds&#8221;
with rye-grass and plantain on the hills, the two latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
have taken possession of the soil, and the clover made
no progress at all; whilst other seed, under precisely
the same circumstances, has done remarkably well.</p>

<p>That there is much reason for these conclusions
will be found in the fact that the more seed we
import from warmer climates the more difficult is it
found to make the land produce a plant; still
importation is rapidly on the increase, because
warmer climates can produce seed more certainly
and in greater quantity than we can at home.</p>

<p>The difficulty of growing from foreign seed increases
in proportion to the thinness of the soil and the backwardness
of the climate, so that the elevated districts
on the stony Cotteswolds just adverted to present,
perhaps, more of the so-called clover-sick land than
any other of like extent.</p>

<p>The seed of clover, then, has become more and
more pampered&#8212;more the offspring of large crops
from deep alluvial soils under the tropical summer
heat of the south of France and the United
States, where it is grown as a self-crop and not fed
merely on what the corn could not carry away; and
so while this enervation, or, if preferred, this civilization,
of plant has gone on, we expect its seed all at
once to withstand the shock of a lower temperature
with constant climatal changes and cutting winds;
and if it does not succeed, we say that the land is
clover-sick, when, in truth, it is the seed that sickens
under these new and trying conditions. As well
may we say that the Northern States sicken of the
negro, because he there dies out so rapidly, or that
the warm south sickens of humanity, because those
who are unacclimated sicken and die there.</p>

<p>Another circumstance which has contributed to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
increased difficulty in growing clover on thin soils
will be found in the farmer discarding as antiquated
the practice of paring and burning, which was
formerly the usual preparation for the turnip crop.
In a paper on &#8220;Paring and Burning,&#8221; in the 18th
volume of the <i>Journal of the Royal Agricultural
Society</i>, Professor Voelcker remarks:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The ashes produced by paring and burning are especially useful to
turnips, and also to other green crops, because they contain a large
proportion of phosphates and potash&#8212;constituents which, it is well
known, favour in a high degree the luxuriant growth of root-crops.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Further, the learned professor closes a most able
paper with the following conclusions:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Paring and burning, instead of being an antiquated operation,
is a practice the advantages of which are fully confirmed and explained
by modern chemical science.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Paring and burning, to judge from our own experience,
had the effect of converting some of the hard
limestone brash into lime, in which case it broke up
by the influences of air and rain, and so restored the
lime and alumina which mostly exist together in
limestone, the former of which is quickly lost in thin
soils,&#8212;so much so, indeed, that not unfrequently the
whole depth of soil, even upon a limestone, will often
be curiously devoid of lime, which is a necessary
ingredient in the constitution of a clover crop.</p>

<p>Again, we should conclude that the operation under
discussion, from its decomposing that dark vegetable
matter called <i>humus</i>, which is always found in large
quantities on some of the soils which are called
&#8220;<i>dead</i>,&#8221; from their inability to produce crops, and
which often cause astonishment that such black,
nice-looking earth should be unproductive. Now this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
soil, though it would favour the growth of some
species of peat-loving plants, as Ling, Heath, &amp;c., is
not suitable for clover, as the wild plant is curiously
absent from peaty positions.</p>

<p>Professor Voelcker remarks that &#8220;the excess of
undecomposed organic matters in soils is decidedly
injurious to vegetation. Roots, stems, and other
vegetable matters remain buried in the ground for
years without undergoing decomposition, and if we
attentively study the subjoined analysis of soil in
the neighbourhood of Cirencester, well adapted for
burning, we shall see how the <i>lime</i>, <i>alumina</i>, and
<i>organic matter</i> might be beneficially affected by the
process:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The ashes, however, are obtained by burning a thin
slice pared from the surface of the land, so that they
are derived from surface-soil and vegetable matter,
the latter often yielding a sufficient amount of
phosphoric acid with which to procure a crop, and,
what is all important for us to consider is, that this
phosphorus, the alkalies, and lime, are rendered by
the burning in a state just fitted for the growth of
the plants that are to be grown upon them; whereas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
before the process, these ingredients were in a measure
locked up, so that plants could not grow for the want
of sustenance; not that it was not in the soil, but
that it was insoluble. If, then, clover or any other
plant had not succeeded, it would have been called
&#8220;clover-sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following analysis of vegetable ashes from a
field in the neighbourhood of Cirencester will well
repay attentive consideration, as illustrating these
points:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Now, that land so burnt and containing such ingredients
would, after the process, refuse to grow clovers
we cannot at all believe; but we do know that some
of the land of a like composition will not grow even
a crop of turnips until prepared as described; and
though the taking a subsequent barley crop off before
the clover would not tend to the improvement of the
latter, it will be too often because the barley has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
taken all the available manurial matter, so that there
is little left for the clover to feed upon. In such
cases we have seen the clover saved by top dressing.
Paring and burning had also a salutary effect upon
the clover crop in the destruction which it wrought
to various insect pests, and more especially the wire-worm,
which now makes such increasing inroads upon
our crops of wheat and barley, and so afterwards in
the clover; so that bare patches, often of great extent,
will be the consequence in every crop in the rotation.
Now, these bare patches in the clover crop are often
appealed to as evidence of clover-sickness, whilst we
do not at the same time say that land is wheat-sick
or barley-sick.</p>

<p>Insects, indeed, are yearly becoming more destructive,
not only on account of the difference in the
mode of farming, but greatly from the determined
destruction of birds. The food of birds is in general
very mixed, but at one season of the year, when they
are breeding, they are most industrious destroyers of
insects; but it is just at this time that they are kept
from the crops, exactly when insects are working the
most mischief: hence, then, as the exigencies of
a small growing family become more and more
pressing, birds are driven to feed their young upon
seeds, fruits, buds, and other vegetable matters, as
unsuitable to build up the constitution of the young
bird as bread diet for an infant.</p>

<p>Let, however, our grand birds of prey be encouraged,
instead of being shot by the keeper as vermin, or
knocked over by the prowling bird-stuffer, in order to
be perched up in a box for sale to some Cockney, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
would fain be considered as fond of sport because
his &#8220;den,&#8221; perchance, contains a stuffed owl, hawk,
magpie, or some other <i>specimen</i>.</p>

<p>On a recent visit to Dorsetshire, on our own farm,
we saw a man employed to &#8220;keep the birds&#8221; from
a field where several labourers were engaged barley
sowing; and it is quite true that, unless he had been
there, the rooks would have as industriously followed
the drill as they do the plough; but, as we thought,
scarcely to pick up barley in the breeding season,
when there was metal more attractive in the recently-hatched
<i>Elater obscurus</i>, parent of the wireworm,
which were thicker than we ever saw them before,
and, doubtless, the disturbance of the soil brought
these and two or three generations of wireworms
to the surface. Now, we do not hesitate to give as
our opinion that this birdkeeper would have done
more good to the barley and the succeeding clover
crop by picking up a hundred or two of these beetles
and destroying them than by blazing away at rooks
for a twelvemonth, and this certainly might have
been done in an hour or two.</p>

<p>Still, that some soils do get incapable of growing
a clover crop is pretty certain; and it may, we think,
be equally settled that this does not entirely depend
upon their having been exhausted of the ingredients
which analysis demonstrates clover to contain, for
we certainly have seen clover succeed after the
burning of so-called clover-sick land; and though
there is reason to think that this result was partially
due to the setting free of a fresh supply of manurial
ingredients, we are still convinced that the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
out of humus or peaty vegetable matter and the
destruction of insects had their share in the induced
change.</p>

<p>Still, however much we may suppose that the
failure of the clover crop is influenced by the alteration
of its constitution as the result of cultivation, the
presence of choking weeds, or by the presence of
prejudicial ingredients, especially in thin soils, there
can be no doubt that the principal cause of the difficulty
will be found in the fact that the corn crop with
which the clover is grown exhausts the soil, in the
most unsparing manner, of the very chemical ingredients
which the clover requires.</p>

<p>Thus, if sheep are folded on a crop of turnips, the
whole of this crop is converted into a manure at once
available for the grain crop, by which it is quickly
appropriated and then taken away. Here, then, we
may suppose at starting that the clover is half starved;
and, with a constitution drawn up in the effort of the
plants to obtain a glance of sunshine, and weakened
for the want of nourishment, it is expected to bear
our inclement winters.</p>

<p>This argument will be made all the clearer if we
place side by side the result of the analyses of barley
and clovers, and especially if we consider what a
quantity of mineral matter is taken in a short time,
and by a crop ripening its straw and seed.</p>

<p>Now, if we look at these figures we shall see how
much of the mineral matter required for the clover
has been previously abstracted by the barley, and if
at the same time we reflect that this robbery may,
and too often does, co-exist with the other causes
which we have instanced as tending to clover-sickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
we should no more call land sick of clover because
it will not bear this crop under our exhaustive system
of cultivation than we should call a barren sand wheat-sick
for refusing to grow corn.</p>

<p>We cannot better conclude this chapter than by
quoting the following from Baron Liebig&#8217;s <i>Letters
on Modern Agriculture</i>, so ably translated by Professor
Blyth:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The simplest peasant has sense enough to see, and all agriculturists
agree with him, that clover, turnips, hay, &amp;c., cannot be sold off from
a farm without most materially damaging the cultivation of the corn.
Every one willingly admits that the sale and exportation of clover,
turnips, &amp;c., exercise a detrimental influence on the growing of corn.
&#8220;Above all, let us take care to have plenty of fodder; the corn crop<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
will then take care of itself.&#8221; But that the <i>exportation of corn</i> may
possibly exercise an injurious influence on the cultivation of clover
or turnips; that it is, above all, indispensable to restore to the soil the
mineral constituents of the corn, to enable the clover or turnip crop
to &#8220;take care of itself;&#8221; in other words, that in order to grow clover,
turnip, &amp;c., we must manure the land&#8212;this is a notion utterly
incomprehensible, nay absolutely impossible, for most agriculturists.
For, is not the clover grown for the sake of manure? What
advantage, then, would there be if it were necessary to manure
again to produce the clover? <i>This clover the farmer expects to grow
for nothing.</i></p>

<p>The mutual relations existing in the order of nature between the
two classes of plants are, however, as clear as daylight. The mineral
constituents of the clover, turnips, &amp;c., and of the corn, form the conditions
for the production of the clover, turnips, &amp;c., and of the corn,
and they are in their elements quite identical. The clovers, &amp;c.,
require for their growth a certain amount of phosphoric acid, potash,
lime, magnesia,&#8212;so does the corn. The mineral constituents contained
in the clover are the same as those in the corn, <i>plus</i> a certain
excess of potash, lime, and sulphuric acid. The clover draws these
constituents from the soil; the cereal plant receives them,&#8212;we may
so represent it from the clover. In selling his clover, therefore, the
farmer removes from his land the conditions for the production of
corn. If, on the other hand, he sells his corn, there will be no clover
crop in the following year; <i>for in his corn he has sold some of
the most essential conditions for the production of a clover crop</i>.&#8212;pp.

<p>This discussion, then, upon the so-called clover-sickness
leads us to adopt the following propositions:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>First. That the larger induced plant of our cultivated
clovers has not, as a rule, that perennial constitution
of the smaller wild species.</p>

<p>Second. Even its induced habit is much deteriorated
by transportation under adverse climatal
circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Third. The seed itself is often full of weeds, which,
by gaining the mastery, kill out the young clover
plant.</p>

<p>Fourth. This effect is enhanced by growing clover
with barley, in which, if not smothered, it must
become weakened.</p>

<p>Fifth. We ought not to expect to grow clover
where we have taken away the necessary substances
for its growth in the corn crop.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE WEEDS OF CLOVERS.</h4>

<p>That clover crops are often very full of weeds every
farmer must be fully aware, but few among them have
used sufficient penetration to have discovered the
source of most of the weed growth, not only in
clovers, but in other crops: how much, then, may
they be expected to be astonished if told that they
cultivate weeds by sowing their seeds as carefully as
they do those of their crops, and that they pay the
same price for weed as for crop seeds!</p>

<p>In the spring of 1859 we published the results of
some analyses of the weed admixtures in several
samples of different kinds of clover seeds, which
we annex (<a href="#TabXXII_1">table 1</a>, p. 149), adding to them some
further results obtained during the present spring,
1863, by way of comparison.</p>

<p>This presents a formidable array of figures, as it
shows how much of more than mere harmless matter
is purchased and sown instead of good seed; and
the fact of the mischief likely to accrue from putting
so many enemies in the place of friends will become
all the more plain by a careful study of the next
table (<a href="#TableXXII_2">No. 2</a>, p. 150).</p>

<p>Now, in order to make this part of our argument
still more complete, we add another table (<a href="#TableXXII_3">No. 3</a>,
p. 150), intending to show the number of weed
plants absolutely separated from a single square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
yard of old seeds taken from a field on the great
oolite rock.</p>

<p>These three tables show us not only the fact that
the farmer sows weeds with his crop, but, as will be
seen from <a href="#TableXXII_2">table 2</a>, quite enough of these in some
cases to stock the land,&#8212;how effectually, indeed, may
be seen from <a href="#TableXXII_3">table 3</a>, where in arable land we find no
less than forty-six plants other than the crop, and
mostly of those species whose seeds will be traced
in dirty samples. To further show that clovers and
their mixtures with grasses called &#8220;seeds&#8221; have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>

<p>These three fields are situate on the Agricultural
College Farm, the substrata of which are forest marble
and great oolite, and 2 and 3 were absolutely adjoining
each other. How different, then, are the species of
wild plants in fields so close together, when out of
a list of sixty-four species only twenty-four, or a
little more than one-third, are common to all three
of the fields examined; and yet we can safely affirm
that the aboriginal flora of any three fields of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
district would scarcely offer half a dozen species in
the one field that could not be found in all; and,
indeed, in a field that had lain fallow for several
years not half of the present list would be found.</p>

<p>That these, then, have to a great extent been sown
with the seed is quite certain; but what tends further
to strengthen the argument is, that the <i>Veronica
Buxbaumii</i> (Buxbaum&#8217;s Speedwell) and the <i>Petroselinum
segetum</i> (Corn Parsley) are not native to the
farm; and, indeed, it is doubtful whether very many
of our agrarian weeds are true natives, as on examination
many weeds will only be found in special
crops, and these occur in the same crops all over the
world wherever those crops can be cultivated. Our
own country, then, has, doubtless, imported a large
portion of her weed flora from abroad, just as we
have traced in the United States, European (not
American) plants, tracking the settlers from England,
Ireland, and Scotland. It is thus that the European
daisy (<i>Bellis perennis</i>) has got the name of the &#8220;White
Man&#8217;s Foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that the clover seeds are so liable to
be dirty, it becomes an important inquiry as to
whether it is possible to get pure seed; and in reply
to this query we should answer, from a long experience,
that though one seldom sees pure clover seed,
yet it sometimes falls in our way, or at least so pure
that its weeds are reduced to a minimum. Such
samples may be expected to be high-priced; but still,
how much cheaper than a dirty article!&#8212;for, independently
of having only the seed of the crop you
wish to cultivate, you are saved the annoyance which
must arise when a weed has taken root, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
then the clover cannot grow, and you ultimately
see the ground occupied by a spreading noxious
plant, or, this dying out, there will be a vacant
spot,&#8212;in either case resulting in a loss of nutriment.</p>

<p>But, besides the more natural method of selling
dirty seed from weedy patches, seedsmen are too apt
to mix the seed of plantain (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>)
with that of clover; for, as the colours of the seeds
are not unlike, and some people speak favourably of
plantain as a sheep-feed, it is unblushingly mixed
and sold with clover seed, though the plantain at
most is only worth about half the price.</p>

<p>Where it occurs naturally amongst clovers, it may
be separated to make a good sample, but only to be
ultimately mixed again and sold to greenhorns with
a cheap sample. We have had before us samples of
clover containing plantain as under:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>In the instance where we had estimated as many
as 1,568,000 plantain seeds to a bushel of clover seed,
the seedsman admitted that he had put it with the
clover at the rate of one pound of plantain to eleven
pounds of clover, under the impression that it was a
desirable pasture plant. Now this we know is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
done; but is it not always charged for as clover in
cases where it is used for adulteration?</p>

<p>This matter, then, of dirty seed is clearly one of
importance: it, however, only wants the farmer to
become acquainted with the true form of clover
seed to enable him to detect any admixture in this;
and then, if he has this knowledge, so requisite
for his well-doing, and steadily abstains from purchasing
the nasty, however cheap, he will soon find
that his seedsman will supply him with a genuine
article, which, all things considered, will be even
cheaper than the opposite.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE PARASITES OF CLOVER.</h4>

<p>Of the truly parasitic plants affecting the clover
crop, we have two genera&#8212;namely, <i>Cuscuta</i> or Dodder,
and <i>Orobanche</i> or Broomrape. Both of these, some
few years since, were comparatively rare as farm
pests; but as they are probably more abundant on
Continental than on our home farms, they are
greatly increasing from the constant influx of foreign
seeds.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cuscuta</span>&#8212;<i>Dodder</i>.</h5>

<p>Of the genus <i>Cuscuta</i> we have two species of
agricultural importance,&#8212;<i>Cuscuta epilinum</i>, the Flax
Dodder, and <i>C. trifolii</i>, the Clover Dodder. In both,
the plant itself consists of a mass of pink and
yellowish tendrils, upon which are placed here and
there compact bunches of flowers varying alike in
colour. The whole plant, in both species, being
entirely parasitic&#8212;that is, it lives wholly on the
juices of its foster-parent,&#8212;it has no leaves of its own;
still, however, the Dodder plant is in the first
instance produced from seed, each flower being succeeded
by a capsule containing two small wrinkled
seeds, which, not being larger or lighter in the
<i>C. epilinum</i> than a linseed, or in the still smaller
seed of the clover, in the case of the <i>C. trifolii</i>, the
seed of flax or clover crops affected with dodder will
never be entirely free from it: as an evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
its large increase, we remember once seeing a crop
of flax grown from Riga seed diminished about
one-twentieth by the dodder; but on the seed so
produced being sown in another field of the same
farm, the crop of flax was well-nigh destroyed.</p>

<p>Our friend Professor Voelcker had some seed of
the flax dodder sent to him for analysis, the reason
being that, as his correspondent had separated a
great number of bushels of this weed pest from a
single crop of flax, he was desirous of ascertaining
whether it possessed any feeding properties or the
reverse; and on this head it is satisfactory to learn
that it is considered useless, though innocuous.</p>

<p>It was part of this sample with which we experimented
on the mode of growth of dodder, which,
although being the dodder of the flax or linseed
plant, yet its natural history will doubtless be that of
the clover dodder;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> we shall, therefore, describe the
progress of our experiments, and their results.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> We are desirous of instituting special experiments on the growth
of clover dodder, but have failed to procure ripe seed, the reason
being that the seed does not ripen after the clover has been cut down
for its first crop.</p></div>

C. Young thread-like plant

D. Not finding a foster-parent, droops and dies.</p>
</div>

<p>Having prepared some finely-sifted soil in a garden
saucer, we sowed a small quantity of flax seed with
which had been purposely mixed a few of the seeds
of flax dodder; this, on being placed in a hot-house,
showed the progress indicated in the <a href="#Diag01">diagram</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>Our next <a href="#Diag02">diagram</a> shows the progress of dodder-growth
when the parasite has germinated sufficiently
near to a young flax plant to be attracted to it. In
such case, instead of dying, it seems all at once to
be animated by new vigour. The highly elastic thread,
which now represents the whole dodder plant, goes
through the following stages:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="figc500"><a name="Diag02" id="Diag02"></a>
<img src="images/illo178.png" alt="Dodder-growth" width="300" height="472" />
<p class="caption just">A. The dodder, having
just clasped a flax
plant, has made two coils
round the stem of the
latter.<br />

B. Meanwhile the flax
in growing lifts the dodder
out of the soil.<br />

C. While the flax is
getting still taller, the
dodder sends out rootlets,
which pierce and
fix themselves into the
flax. During this the
dodder sends out buds
upwards, which, elongating
until new flax
plants are met with, explains
not only how the
dodder commences a
growth quite independent
of the soil, but, by
spreading, from plant to
plant, thus increases to
an indefinite extent.</p>
</div>

<p>In this way, then, the dodder of flax, commencing
from seeds at different points, spreads in more or
less extended patches, which, if such centre be few,
will be distinct; if many, the pest may occupy the
greater part of the crop by spreading, and so becoming
confluent.</p>

<p>Such is the method of growth of flax dodder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
we have no doubt but that the dodder of the clover
progresses in like manner; at all events, we see the
latter occupying more or less isolated patches in the
affected crop; and in this case, as in the former, the
crop-plant is not only starved, from having &#8220;its
verdure sucked out,&#8221; but it is borne down to the
ground and ruined.</p>

<p>As regards its destruction, we should be careful to
look at our crops in their early growth, as, if the
sickly-looking, wire-like tendril be observed then,
it is easily removed by hand; if, however, it has
made head, the best way would be to make a trench
of a foot wide around the plague-spots, which will
prevent its spreading, as the plant must have contiguous
clovers to twist round if it is to extend; and
then burn some straw on the dodder plot, and it will
be wasted to death. Probably, however, the easiest
plan is to depasture the crop,&#8212;certainly not to seed
it down&#8212;in which case it will be impossible for any
dodder seeds to ripen.</p>

<p>But here, as in other cases, the evil will be prevented
by sowing pure seed, whether of flax or of
clover; and as the dodder is a small, brown, roundish
little seed, so different from that of either crop, there
is no difficulty in recognizing it where present.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Orobanche</span>&#8212;<i>Broomrape</i>.</h5>

<p>The Broomrape is now becoming a very pernicious
clover weed, especially in lighter soils. We have
seen it on clover near Stonehenge so thick as to have
positively spoiled the crop; and we should expect
from its bitter, disagreeable flavour, that if cattle
did not universally refuse to eat it, it might prove
mischievous to them.</p>

<p>The species which attacks clover is the <i>Orobanche</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<i>minor</i>&#8212;Lesser Broomrape,&#8212;which is at once distinguished
in a clover field by its upright brownish
spike of dead, dry-looking, lipped flowers; the stem
without true leaves, but clothed with small brown
leaf-like processes (<i>bracts</i> of the botanist), which, with
the stem, are clothed with hairs.</p>

<p>This plant, which is much larger and very different
from the clover, is parasitic on the principal division
of the clover root; so that if the soil be carefully
removed from the broomrape, it will be found to
swell at the base, into which the clover root may be
detected to be fastened, and a very odd appearance
indeed has the small-stemmed clover united to so
comparatively large a parasite.</p>

<p>The seeds of the broomrape are so small as scarcely
to be detected in a sample of clover seed; indeed,
several may be fastened to a seed as dust, so that
whatever care may be used in the selection of seed
will hardly prevent this pest. Any great injury to
the clover crop may be speedily stopped by hand-picking
the broomrape; for, although it will sometimes
branch up again, it will be much lessened, and
the few secondary shoots will usually be very weak.</p>

<p>Clovers are attacked by <i>Epiphytes</i>&#8212;that is, minute
fungoid plants growing upon the leaves; but the
natural history of these is too obscure for a general
treatise, nor are they of sufficient interest to the
practical farmer.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD CORN.</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<h4>NATURE OF CORN.</h4>

<p>By corn, in its enlarged sense, the farmer means all
such crops as are grown for their seeds; so that all
kinds of grain and pulse, such as peas and beans,
belong to the corn crop, as distinguished from roots
and green crops. In America the word &#8220;corn&#8221; is
restricted to maize or Indian corn, and other crops
are called after their respective names. Our dictionaries
define corn as &#8220;seeds which grow in ears,
not pods;&#8221; and it is to these that the present treatise
is meant exclusively to apply, confining our remarks
for the most part to such kinds as are more commonly
cultivated in this country.</p>

<p>Corn, then, may be said to be derived from different
species of grasses, whose seeds are sufficiently large
to enable them to be threshed from the ear and
become stored as grain, in which case it differs from
the smaller kinds, whose seeds may be grown for
pasturage crops.</p>

<p>Hence, then, grasses afford us two sets, which are
differently used,&#8212;one, as affording corn fabled to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the gift of the goddess Ceres, and so called cereal or
corn grasses; the other, not grown for the sake of
the grain, but for herbage, and named meadow and
pasture grasses.</p>

<p>Corn grasses, then, belong exclusively to arable
cultivation; and, indeed, it may be concluded that
such have been derived from wild species, and that
continued culture has brought them about, and still
maintains them in all their endless varieties, and also
gives us a power to add to these to an extraordinary
extent.</p>

<p>It is this facility for improvement, this capability
for forming grain on the one hand, and running into
varieties on the other, which enables corn to be
grown under so wide a range of temperature and in
such varied and variable climates; and it is a knowledge
of the laws affecting these changes, and the
modes of action in the growth of corn consequent
thereupon, which will constitute &#8220;Science and
Practice in Corn Cultivation,&#8221; and should lead to
a knowledge of &#8220;How to Grow Good Corn.&#8221;</p>

<p>In following out this inquiry, we shall, for the
most part, confine our observations to the following
crops:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<h4>WHEAT: ITS ORIGIN AND ACCLIMATIZATION.</h4>

<p>It is a popular belief that wheat, in a state fit for
food, was a direct gift to man, and handed down to
him unaltered in form, except in so far as relates to
varieties; but if we consider how varied are the
details of this plant, how very different from each
other are the more remote varieties, and yet how
easy it is to fill up the links on the one hand, or to
arrive at equally distinct and yet new forms on the
other, we can only conclude that wheat, like most,
if not all, our vegetable esculents, is but a <i>derivative</i>
plant obtained from a wild form of grass, and in
very early times brought into cultivation because
of the facilities for change which it was capable of
undergoing.</p>

<p>Nowhere is wheat, as such, found wild; for,
although its grain has been cultivated in all parts
of the world, its scattered seeds cannot maintain a
position for any length of time; for, as it has been
obtained by cultivation, so its derived status can only
be maintained by careful culture, without which
there seems reason to believe that cereal wheat
would indeed become extinct.</p>

<p>Many botanists had arrived at these or kindred
views from observation and reasoning upon the subject,
but it was not until a comparatively recent
period that we possessed any direct evidence derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
from experiment: this we now have, and upon it we
quote the following from Mr. Bentham, in the
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture</i>, article &#8220;Triticum&#8221;:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>It has never been contended that their original types have become
extinct, and various, therefore, have been the conjectures as to the
transformations they may have successively undergone; and as no
accidental returns towards primitive forms have been observed, we
have till lately had but little to guide us in these vague surmises.
Within the last few years, however, the experiments and observations
of M. Esprit Fabre, of Agde, in the south of France, seem to prove
a fact which had been more than once suggested, but almost always
scouted, that our agricultural wheats are cultivated varieties of a set
of grasses common in the south of Europe, which botanists have
uniformly regarded as belonging to a different genus, named <i>&AElig;gilops</i>.
The principal character by which the latter genus had been distinguished,
consisted in the greater fragility of the ear, and in the
glumes (<i>i.e.</i> the chaff-scales) being generally terminated by three or
four, and the pales by two or three points or awns (beards). But
M. Fabre has shown how readily these characters become modified
by cultivation; and, wide as is the apparent difference between
<i>&AElig;gilops ovata</i> and common wheat, he has practically proved their
botanical identity; for, from the seeds of the <i>&AElig;gilops</i> first sown in
1838, carefully raised in a garden soil, and re-sown every year from
their produce, he had, through successive transformations, by the
eighth year (1846) obtained crops of real wheat as good as the
generality of those cultivated in his neighbourhood.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was the description of the experiments of M.
Fabre, in the <i>Journal of the Agricultural Society</i>,
which led us to institute independent inquiries, to
which end, having purchased some seeds of <i>&AElig;gilops
ovata</i>, we sowed them in our experimental garden
at Cirencester, in a prepared plot of five yards square,
on a subsoil of forest marble. From this seeds
were selected to carry on the experiments, whilst
the mass of the plants in the plot were allowed to
seed and come up spontaneously, which it did year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
after year, and so preserved the original type with
which we started. The preserved seeds were sown in
fresh plots year by year, but&#8212;perhaps owing to the
coldness of the soil and the general lower climate of
the Cotteswolds&#8212;progress was only slow at first;
however, in the warm summer of 1859 our plot of
the season had made fresh advances, which will be
best understood by an examination of the accompanying
drawings.</p>

<p><a href="#CornFig">Fig. 3</a> represents a spikelet of the type of <i>&AElig;gilops
ovata</i>, introduced into our garden in 1855. In this
some of the pales have double awns, others single
ones. <a href="#CornFig">Fig. 4</a>, a spikelet of 1859, modified by cultivation.
In this the awns are single. <a href="#CornFig">Fig. 5</a>, a spikelet
from an ear of bearded wheat.</p>

<p>Now, the close affinity of these three forms must
strike any one; but we feel justified in concluding
that, had not our experiments been peremptorily
stopped, and the results, as far as possible, spoiled
from the ignorance and jealousy of the new Principal,
we should before this have arrived at results much
more satisfactory.</p>

<p>The principles of the observed changes will be
understood by stating the following facts.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>&AElig;gilops ovata</i> has a seed of sufficient size to be
called a corn grain, and which, though not so large
as that of wheat, yet rapidly improves by cultivation,
which includes selection.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>rachis</i> (the part on which the spikelets
are placed in the wild grass) is exceedingly brittle,
so that it readily breaks into bits below each
spikelet; this brittleness annually gets less under
cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><i>c.</i> The wild grass has a trailing habit of growth;
but uprightness and a longer culm is at once induced
by the closer contact of drilling the seeds in thick
rows.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The cultivation of <i>&AElig;gilops</i>, and especially subjecting
it to rich soil, produces the same kinds of
fungoid attacks as are found with wheats under like
circumstances, as thus:&#8212;<i>Puccinia graminis</i> (mildew)
of the leaves and culms; <i>Uredo rubigo</i> (red rust) of the
chaff-scales; <i>Uredo caries</i> (smut or bunt) of the
grain.</p>

<p>Now, all these circumstances seem to point to a
similarity in essential structure, and a uniformity of
habit somewhat remarkable in plants which at first
sight would strike one as being so different; but as
these differences between <i>&AElig;gilops</i> and any variety of
wheat are often all scarcely greater than is to be met
with on contrasting two known varieties of wheat,
we may agree in concluding that the evidence warrants
the assumption that wheat, as a cultivated
cereal, has been derived from <i>&AElig;gilops</i>.</p>

<p>If, then, we view the wheat plant as a derivative,
we shall be at no loss in understanding how the
vast number of varieties have been brought about&#8212;varieties
applicable, too, to a wide range of climatal
conditions; and the ease with which new forms can
be brought about by hybridization and selection is a
matter of importance, because older varieties, too often
repeated, are apt to degenerate both in quality of
grain and quantity of crop. But when we speak of
acclimatizing wheat, we think it would be excessively
difficult to make any existing form grow well in a
climate not congenial to it, though it might be easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to arrive at a new variety possessing some desired
quality. We believe, however, that it is not difficult
to alter a climate to suit a sort, and, in all probability,
this at the present day much-used term of
&#8220;acclimatization&#8221; simply means no more than
making our cultivation and climate accord as nearly
as possible to the habits of the plant or animal to
be entertained under new conditions.</p>

<p>Thus, when we see the finer white wheats growing
good crops on farms where such would have been
impossible a few years ago, we are hardly to conclude
that we have at length got this more delicate sort to
become more hardy; but the climate has been ameliorated
by draining and better cultivation.</p>

<p>We distinctly recollect when the lias clays of the
Vale of Gloucester could scarcely be made to grow a
good crop of even the hardier sorts of red wheat, the
common cone being the sort generally grown. This
was succeeded by many sorts of red wheat, and now
only the best-cultivated farms produce white wheats.
These, however, are facts which will be more strongly
brought out when we consider the subject of cultivation;
for the present we would be content with the
expression of a belief that wheat, as a cereal grain,
is derived by cultivation from a wild grass, and it is
due to the effects of cultivation that we have so many
sorts, with such variable adaptability.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<h4>THE WILD OAT AS THE ORIGIN OF THE CULTIVATED
VARIETIES.</h4>

<p>Crop oats, like wheat, have ever been considered as
a direct gift from Ceres, and few, indeed, amongst
scientific men were willing to believe that they were
derived from a wild and weed species. Still, the
farmer had long maintained that oats, when cultivated,
often left behind them weed oats; and in some
districts of Worcester, Gloucester, and Warwick, we
have known men refuse to grow oats as a crop from
their fear of producing the terrible weed, which,
indeed, the wild oat is on all hands admitted to be.</p>

<p>Now, although we by no means wish to advance
the theory of transmutation, and cannot believe that
by any plan barley can be converted into oats, or
oats into barley, we are yet confident that what has
been termed <i>ennobling</i>, or the producing of a cultivated
plant from a wild one, is oftentimes comparatively
easy, and in none more so than in the
production of crop oats from the wild species,
<i>Avena fatua</i>.</p>

<p>Professor Lindley, in the article &#8220;Avena,&#8221; in
Morton&#8217;s <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture</i>, suggests that
the cultivated oat &#8220;is a domesticated variety of some
wild species, and may be not improbably referred to
<i>Avena strigosa</i>, bristle-pointed oat;&#8221; but our experiments
would show that the <i>Avena fatua</i> is the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
from which at least the domestic sorts in general
cultivation seem to have sprung.</p>

<p>The <i>Avena fatua</i> (wild oat) is an annual grass
which almost universally accompanies agrarian circumstances;
that is to say, it seldom, if ever, occurs
in a truly wild aboriginal state, and is therefore not
found in uncultivated tracts, but is the common
attendant on tillage, and in some soils is a most
common and disagreeable weed in various agricultural
crops, but more especially amid grain, whether
of wheat, barley, or oats. Sometimes it is found
with beans, peas, and vetches, and, indeed, it may
be said to be a common weed in some districts in any
crop from which it has not been eradicated by the
hoe&#8212;an operation almost impossible in grain, as its
growth is so much like that of the crop itself.</p>

<p>It is a tall grass, rivalling the height of the finest
cultivated oat crop, from some forms of which, and
especially those with a lax panicle, it is at first not
easily distinguished; however, a more careful examination
and comparison with the so-called <i>Avena
sativa</i> (cultivated oat) enables us to make out the
following differences:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>The experiments about to be detailed were performed
with the <i>Avena fatua</i>.</p>

<p>In 1851, a quantity of this plant was noticed by
the author on the farm of C. Lawrence, Esq., near
Cirencester. It was mixed with a patch of mangel-wurzel
which had been planted for seed; and from
these specimens sufficient seeds were preserved wherewith
to sow one of our experimental plots.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the substratum was
forest marble, and no doubt the seeds of the oat
were brought with the manure by which the mangold
patch was dressed.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1852 a plot of two and a half
yards square was sown with seed which had been
kept during the winter&#8212;a fact which should be carefully
noted, as it forms a first and most important
link in the chain of evidence, and constituting what
we term a cultivative process, inasmuch as in wild
growth the seeds are sown as soon as they become
ripe.</p>

<p>The seeds of the first crop came up well, and on
ripening, towards autumn, the plants were tall and
robust; the grains presented a scarcely appreciable
difference from the wild examples; if any, there may
have been a slight tendency to an increased plumpness
of grain.</p>

<p>The seeds of crop No. 1 were again collected and
preserved throughout the winter, and sown in a
patch of similar size, but in a different part of the
garden, in the spring of 1853, repeating the process
with the successive crops in 1854 and 1855, with
slight alterations from year to year, though in some
examples the following tendencies seemed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
first to be gaining strength in some few of the
specimens:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. A gradual decrease in the quantity of hairs
on the pales.<br />
2nd. A more tumid grain, in which the pales were
less coarse and the awn not so strong and rigid, and
less black than in the wild example.<br />
3rd. A gradual increased development of kernel or
flower.</p>

<p>The seeds of 1855 crop, without selection, were
treated in the same manner during the winter, and
were sown in the spring of 1856, the resulting crop
in August of the same year presenting the following
curious circumstances:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. <i>Avena fatua</i> (typical wild oat), with large
loose panicles of flowers,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> thin hairy florets, with a
bent awn twisted at the base. Five parts of crop.<br />
2nd. <i>Avena fatua</i>, var. <i>sativa</i>, with loose panicles
of flowers, florets quite smooth, tumid, with or
without straight awns, some few examples slightly
hairy towards the base. This is the potato-oat type.
Six parts of crop.<br />
3rd. <i>Avena fatua</i>, var. <i>sativa</i>&#8212;Panicles more compact,
flowers inclining to one side, grains more tumid
than 2nd, quite devoid of hairs, awn straight. These
present the type of the white Tartarian oat. Twelve
parts of crop. Fig. 2. See <a href="#CornFig">plate</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Some examples of this plant, gathered at Framilode, in the Vale
of Gloucester, in the past autumn, gave as many as 750 seeds to a
root, from which its rate of increase as a weed may be imagined.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>Having now procured a crop of separate types of
oat from the same seed, we preserved them distinct,
and this year carried on our experiments by cultivating
a patch of each, whilst the plot of 1856 was
left with self-sown seeds, in order that it should again
become wild by degeneracy.</p>

<p>From these experiments, then, we may conclude
that different types of crop oats are derived from
the <i>Avena fatua</i>, or wild oat; but, besides this, they
open out a subject for inquiry of great practical interest
and importance, which may be clearly stated
as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>If by cultivation the wild oat assumes the cultivated
form, then by degeneracy cultivated oats may
become wild ones.</p>

<p>Those who know what a detestable weed is the
wild oat wherever it occurs, and how difficult it is to
eradicate,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> will at once see the cogency of the question
involved.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The author once went with a rector of a parish in Gloucestershire
to examine the glebe allotments of the poor people, when,
catching sight of an apparent crop of oats, the landlord threatened to
dispossess the tenant, &#8220;because he had carelessly left his crop without
gathering.&#8221; However, the matter was explained when it was pointed
out that the land was planted with wheat, which the oats had quite
smothered.</p></div>

<p>Farmers in some districts, and more especially on
stiff clay soils, have ever objected to the cultivation
of oats, as they had always maintained that they left
behind a crop of weed oats. This, which was never
a favourite idea with the botanist, who is generally
too much inclined to species-making, seems now to
have a basis of truth, for not only is it confirmed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the experiments described, but observation of an independent
kind points to the same truth.</p>

<p>On examining the produce of shed, or accidentally
scattered oat seeds, the first crop will often present
the wild tendency in a partial reversion to the hairy
state, an elongation and thickening of the awn, and a
lessening of the size of the kernel; and this more particularly
on heavy soils. It was, indeed, an observation
of this change in oats scattered on forest marble
clay which induced us to try the experiments above
detailed; and as the subsoil of our botanical
garden is the same clay, we are, perhaps, indebted
to this cause for arriving so soon at such signal
results.</p>

<p>Again, it is known in farming that some clay lands
will never produce heavy oats; a sample, however
good, is sure to degenerate upon such soils. Hence,
then, the foregoing experiments and observations lead
to the following conclusions:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. The wild oat is perhaps not a native of
Britain, but derived through the degeneracy of the
cereal crop; and hence its occurrence only as an
agrarian.<br />

2nd. The cereal oat, on the contrary, is the result
of the impress of cultivative processes upon the wild
form, and as such liable to lapse into the wild state
with greater or less celerity, according to the circumstances
of soil and situation.</p>

<p>These conclusions are of practical value, as they
show the direction in which experiments should be
conducted in order to attain to varieties, it being a
well-known fact that one variety is suitable for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
soil, and another for a different kind of land. And
again, as some forms of plants would seem to have
the tendency of wearing out by long cultivation, so
we have the means of applying to the original source
of their production, and thus of commencing a new
generation.</p>

<p>They teach us, too, the necessity of avoiding the
growth of the oat crop in some situations, and which in
the case before us is not the result of the &#8220;pigheadedness&#8221;
with which the farmer is often so thoughtlessly
accused, but a conclusion founded in reason;
and if we consider how robust is the growth of the
wild oat, and that its support is secured by robbing
the grain crop with which it occurs as a weed&#8212;the
difficulty of separating it from the crop where it has
gained a footing&#8212;and, above all, that its succession
is secured by its seeds universally ripening a few
days before that of the crop with which it is mixed,
and the moment they are ripe they fall and become
self-sown,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&#8212;we can see abundant reason for wholesome
fear as to the introduction of cereal oats in districts
liable to their degeneracy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The wild forms shed their seeds much more readily than the
cultivated ones, and are, besides, earlier in ripening, and thus much of
our wild seed had dropped before the other forms were fully ripe;
and it much assists experiments in transmutation not to let the seeds
with which they are to be carried on become dead ripe. This is
another cultivative process.</p></div>

<p>The annexed enlarged <a href="#OatFig">figure</a> of a bunch of wild
oat seeds will sufficiently illustrate the changes necessary
to produce the cultivated form.</p>

<p>Under cultivation, which supposes the <i>selection,
saving up, and sowing in a prepared</i> bed of our seed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the wild oat seed gradually becomes smooth externally,
and its awn less
coarse, while internally
the grain becomes
larger and heavier;
so that while the
seed of the wild oat
would weigh about
15 lb. per bushel, that
of a fine sample of
white cultivated oat
sown on our farm
this year weighed as
much as 48 lb. per
bushel.</p>

<p>Now, the proof of
this theory consists
in the facts<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. That heavy
oats degenerate by
being <i>cultivated</i> in
poor soil.</p>

<p>2nd. By <i>being let go wild</i>, they sink still lower, and
gradually assume the external hairs, stiff awns, and
poor grain of the wild oat.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE SUPPOSED ORIGIN OF BARLEY AND RYE.</h4>

<p>The cereal barley is found to offer three important
forms, which can be best explained by the annexed
diagramatic arrangement:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</tr>

</table>

<p>The two-rowed barley has been named <i>Hordeum
distichum</i>; and as we are inclined, with Professor
Lindley, to the belief that this is the original from
whence the other forms have sprung, we here quote
the learned Professor&#8217;s remarks upon this and the
probably allied forms:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>&#8220;It is probable,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that all kinds of barley grown by
farmers are varieties of one species, of which, the <i>H. distichum</i> of
Linn&aelig;us is the type. The spikelets of this genus always standing in
threes, and the threes being placed back to back, it is evident that
every ear of barley must consist of six rows of spikelets. If the
middle spikelet of each set of threes is alone perfect, the side spikelets
being abortive, we have <i>H. distichum</i>, the common two-rowed
barley, and its many varieties; if the two-tuberal of each set is
perfect, and the central spikelet imperfect, as sometimes happens,
then we have four-rowed barley; if, on the other hand, all the spikelets
are perfect, we have six-rowed barley, or <i>H. hexastichum</i>;<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but the cases of four-rowed barley have been merely accidental&#8212;they
may be referred to the six-rowed form; and thus we have only
two principal kinds of barley&#8212;namely, <i>H. distichum</i> and <i>H. hexastichum</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;1. <i>H. distichum.</i>&#8212;This is the only kind of barley that has been
found apparently wild. We have now before us specimens gathered
in Mesopotamia during Col. Chesney&#8217;s expedition to the Euphrates,
with narrow ears, a little more than an inch long, exclusive of the
awn, or four and a half inches awns included; and others from the
ruins of Persepolis, with ears scarcely so large as starved rye. Both
are straw-colour, but that from Mesopotamia has the glumes much
more hairy than the other. The plant is also said to inhabit Tartary.
The report that it grows wild in Sicily seems to have arisen
from the Mediterranean <i>&AElig;gilops ovata</i> having been mistaken for it.
To this species belong all the varieties, from one to sixteen, formerly
mentioned under Barley; as also does No. 20, fig. 34<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&#8212;the <i>H. zeocriton</i>,
sprat or battledore barley, an undoubted result of domestication,
chiefly remarkable for the ears being so much broader at the
base than the point as to produce a long ovate figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. <i>H. hexastichum.</i>&#8212;We found no record of this having been
found wild, and presume it and its numerous varieties to be domesticated
forms of <i>H. distichum</i>. The common bere, or winter barley,
may be taken as the typical form to which Nos. 18, 21, and 22, and
figs. 37 and 38<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> are evidently referable, varying in size, colour, and
hairiness, more than in any other circumstance deserving botanical
appreciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>H. vulgare</i> of Linn&aelig;us is a form with the grains in four
rows, the naked-eared variety of which is again the <i>H. c&#339;leste</i> of some
writers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both these forms of barley vary with naked seed, the pales losing
their adhesion to the grain. But this difference is attended with no
other peculiarity.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. The <i>H. trifurcatum</i>, also known under Dr. Royle&#8217;s name of
<i>H. &aelig;giceras</i>, is a very remarkable naked-seeded species, with much
the appearance of wheat. It is a tall or glaucous six-rowed sort, but
the rows are not placed in lines with the same exactness as in the
two former kinds, so that the ears are round like wheat. The pales<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
are apparently in a monstrous form, the ends being three-lobed, and
curved back in the form of horns, which sometimes extend into awns.
It has been introduced from the Himalaya Mountains within a few
years, but its economical qualities remain to be determined.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> See Morton&#8217;s <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture</i>.</p></div>

<p>We have had opportunities, through the kindness of
Professor Lindley, who contributed seeds, of cultivating
all the forms just described; but our experiments
for two years did not elicit anything new upon the
subject: we therefore feel justified in quoting the
above entire, especially as the different forms in our
plots afforded sufficient evidence of an uniformity of
origin on the one hand, with every disposition for
forming varieties on the other.</p>

<p>Rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>).&#8212;For the little that is known
of the natural history and origin of this crop-plant
we again quote from the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture</i>,
which states as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>&#8220;The common rye is a cereal grass, distinguished from wheat by
its narrow glumes and constantly twin narrow florets, with a membranous
abortion between them. Otherwise it is little different in
structure, although the quality of its grain is so inferior. According
to Karl Koch, it is found undoubtedly wild on the mountains of the
Crimea, especially all around the village of Dshimil, on granite, at the
elevation of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. In such places, its ears are not
more than 1 to 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long. Its native country explains the
reason why it is so much hardier than any variety of wheat, the
southern origin of which is now ascertained.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We have not seen any of this so-called wild rye; it
would, however, be of great service could some good
experiments be made with it, with a view of noting
the changes which take place on cultivation. Indeed,
we have long wished for authentic examples of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
our wild, or supposed wild, cereals, with a view of
examining side by side the nature and amount of
the changes which cultivation would most assuredly
produce.</p>

<p>Rye, unlike either wheat or barley, is not remarkable
for a long list of varieties&#8212;a fact which may,
perhaps, be attributed to the more limited growth
of the former than the two latter. Its less extended
cultivation must be attributed to its inferior qualities
as food; for, though rye is in the main a hardier
plant than wheat, and therefore could withstand the
evils of a colder climate and colder treatment, yet
with the advanced climate&#8212;the acclimatization of a
country rather than a plant&#8212;the superior plant,
wheat, everywhere prevails; and this cause also gives
rise to the production of finer varieties, which are
thus grown where only coarser ones were possible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<h4>EPIPHYTICAL PARASITES (VEGETABLE BLIGHTS) OF
CORN CROPS.</h4>

<p>These forms of parasite are so numerous, that nearly
every species of flowering plant may become the
nidus even of several named genera, with many
species, or, at least, varieties of them. We here say
attacked, because the advent of many of their forms
passes under the name of &#8220;blight;&#8221; a term which at
once recognises their injurious tendency.</p>

<p>Whether these epiphytes are the causes of the so-called
blighted conditions, or merely their effects, is
a subject upon which no little discussion has been
expended. We do not, however, mean to re-open
the question here; we will only remark, that in all
probability this very wide range of the lower tribes
of the vegetable kingdom is very variable in these
respects.</p>

<p>Again: it will be impossible to enter into details
of the different species of epiphytes. We shall hope,
therefore, to elucidate their natural history, in so far
as the farmer is concerned, by pointing out the more
general facts connected with the following forms:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Uredo segetum</i>, Smut or Dust-brand, is common
to barley, and not unfrequent in wheat; in both of
which crops it is easily recognised from the affected
ears of corn appearing as though they had been powdered
over from the sweep&#8217;s soot-bag. On closely
examining these blackened ears, we find that the
whole flower has, as it were, effloresced into a black
powder, which, on being placed under the microscope,
is shown to be composed of myriads of granules, called
by the fungologist <i>spores</i>, in which latter are contained
still smaller grains, or <i>sporidia</i>.</p>

<p>These black spores are all washed away by the time
the crop is ripe, leaving the stalks bare and grainless,
so that the sample suffers no injury from this blight,
which, even if present after threshing, would only
tend to a slight discoloration of the sample, which is
remediable by the smutter. Its chief effect, however,
consists in causing the loss of much grain. We have
observed it to the extent of as much as an eighth, but
usually the diminution is about equal to the amount
of seed sown; though it is not improbable that the
whole crop may in many cases be greater when the
smut is present. Sheep-folding previous to barley,
special manuring for this crop, and other causes of
increased fertility, are constant causes of the increase
of the dust-brand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Uredo caries</i>&#8212;Bunt, Pepper-brand, Smut-balls.&#8212;This
blight differs from the preceding in the fact
that in the grain no flower is formed, but its interior
becomes filled with a dark powder, which, when
viewed under a high magnifying power, is found to
consist of granules, with a surface which is rough, and
not smooth as in the dust-brand.</p>

<p>In most cases, the whole grains of the ear will be so
affected; in others, only a portion of them. They will
be gathered in the harvest, and as the diseased grain is
readily crushed, the black powder materially damages
the appearance of the sample. Nor is this all: this
blight has a most disagreeable odour and flavour,
both of which are communicated to the sample, and
so, besides diminishing the amount of produce, it
greatly deteriorates it. Its specific name of <i>caries</i>
of course refers to this fact, as also does that of
<i>U. f&#339;tida</i>, adopted by Baur, an author to whom
we are greatly indebted for information upon these
curious productions.</p>

<p>Before considering the remedy for this evil, it will
be well to distinguish it from the &#8220;purples, ear-cockle,
or peppercorn&#8221; (<i>vibrio tritici</i>)&#8212;a name expressive
of its animal origin, and frequently rendered
&#8220;wheat-eels.&#8221; In the purples, the grain is shorter
than a healthy wheat grain, irregular in shape
(cockled), and purple externally; but its interior is
filled with what, to the naked eye, is like very short
white cotton-wool. On placing a bit of this woolly
substance with the point of a needle on a slip of
glass, just touching it with water and submitting it
to a high magnifying power, the term &#8220;wheat-eel&#8221;
will at once be seen to be justified; for, if alive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thousands of eel-like creatures will be seen writhing
in the fluid.</p>

<p>The differences of these two affections of wheat
may be expressed as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<table class="narrow fsize80" summary="Wheat affections">

</tr>

</table>

<p>As regards the ear-cockle, we incline to the belief
that a damp atmosphere and cold soil are chiefly
concerned in its spread, if not in its production. As
we have shown the difference between it and bunt, we
now proceed to offer a few remarks upon the production
of the latter, and its remedies.</p>

<p>Bunt is mainly produced by defective seed. It
occurs on all kinds of soils&#8212;sands, clays, and limestones&#8212;and
is not peculiar to any climate. Professor
Henslow believes the disease to be wholly propagated
by the spores of the fungus adhering to the wheat-seed.
He says, &#8220;It has been clearly proved that
wheat plants may be easily infected, and the disease
thus propagated, by simply rubbing the seeds before
they are sown with the black powder or spores of the
fungus. It is also clearly ascertained that if seeds
thus tainted be thoroughly cleansed, the plants raised
from them will not be infected;&#8221; and he deduces
from this a proof in favour of steeping; for he says,
&#8220;This fact is now so well established, that the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of washing or steeping seed wheat in certain
solutions almost universally prevails.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> See an essay on <i>Diseases of Wheat</i>, in the <i>Journal of the Royal
Agricultural Society</i> for 1841, by the Rev. Professor Henslow.</p></div>

<p>Our own experiments, however, recorded in the
&#8220;Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society&#8221; for
1856, led us to conclude that the success derived
from pickling wheat in different caustic and corrosive
solutions arose from the fact of diseased grain being
destroyed in the process; and we extract the following
record of experiments made in 1853, as explaining
this view of the matter.</p>

<p>Four plots of wheat, all from the same sample,
were sown in the following order:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="Plots">

<tr>
<td class="center" style="width: 8em;">1.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td class="center bl bt br bb">Perfect picked seed, with sulphate of copper.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The results of these were as under:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Plot 1. Most of the seed germinated, but the crop
was much blighted, both in straw and grain; in fact,
scarcely a perfect ear of the latter.</p>

<p>Plot 2. A small quantity of the seed germinated;
the few resulting ears were free from blight.</p>

<p>Plot 3. Germinated, with a good and clean resulting
crop.</p>

<p>Plot 4. The same result as Plot 3.</p>

<p>These experiments seemed to show that the pickling
of wheat destroys the seed, so as to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
germination when the seed is diseased or ill-formed;
but if perfect seed be always employed, no pickling
at all is necessary, it being strictly true that a
diseased progeny must result from an imperfect stock
in plants no less than in animals.</p>

<p>We have said that bunt is not peculiar to any
climate; we have, however, always observed that
employing seed from a warm district on a cold one,
or using the finer white wheats in cold, exposed, or
ill-drained situations, is sure to produce a large
quantity of this fungus. Autumn-sown wheat, too,
is less liable to the infection than spring wheat,
which we attribute to the fact that many of the
weaker plants will succumb to the cold rain and
frost.</p>

<p>3. <i>Uredo rubigo</i> (Red-rust, Red-rag, Red-robin)
makes its appearance in the inside of the chaff-scales,
and ultimately in the green epidermis of the growing
grains of wheat. Its first appearance is that of oval
pustules, caused by the raising of the skin, which,
ultimately bursting, shows the orange-coloured spores
of the epiphyte. This must not be confounded with
<i>Cecidomyia tritici</i> (wheat-midge), the larv&aelig; of which
are of a bright orange-colour; in the latter, the living
moving worms may be easily detected by any common
pocket lens or magnifying glass. Both these pests,
to which we would apply the distinctive terms of
<i>Uredo rubigo</i> (red-rust) and <i>Cecidomyia tritici</i> (red-gum),
are exceedingly common in some seasons, and
not unfrequently in the same crop. Good deep cultivation
is the best remedy for the rust; but the
treatment of the fly is a different matter. We would
suggest the burning of smother-heaps on calm days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
just as the wheat is bursting into ear, as smoke is
decidedly obnoxious to these small insects, which in
some seasons may be seen in thousands about the
bursting wheat.</p>

<p>4 and 5. <i>Uredo linearis</i>; <i>Puccinia graminis</i> (Straw-rust
and Mildew).&#8212;We refer to these epiphytes under
one heading, as there can be but little doubt that the
latter is a more advanced state of the former. They
both occur in oblong patches on the leaves and straw
of wheats and other grasses: in the <i>uredo</i> stage, of a
dull red colour; in the <i>puccinia</i> stage, of a blackish
hue. They are both, as, indeed, are all these fungi,
interesting microscopic objects; but our object now is
to describe them popularly. Both will always be found
in abundance in cold poor soils, and more especially
if the finer wheats be grown in such situations. The
application of a dressing of salt to the soil is said to
be a preventive. Be this as it may, the disease is
said to be rarer in Cheshire, where salt is so much
used by the farmer, than in any other county, in as
far as we have observed.</p>

<p>Here, again, we incline to think that these are
morbid affections of the plant. They are, indeed,
viewed as such by Unger, in his &#8220;Die Exantheme
Pflanzen,&#8221; in which the very title classes them with
eruptive diseases of animals. Berkeley and Henslow,
the two great authorities, however, do not accord
with this view: the former remarks in reference to
it&#8212;&#8220;Surely these plants are too distinctly, too regularly,
and too beautifully organized to be the products
of disease like warts or purulent matter in animals.&#8221;
As, however, the microscope demonstrates that warts
and eruptive diseases have also their special and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
curiously formed organisms, such a mode of reasoning
is not conclusive.</p>

<p>Weeds have a great influence in producing mildew,
which perhaps may be accounted for from the fact
that weeds are in active growth as the wheat-stalks
decline in vigour; and hence the constant evaporation
of moisture from the weeds to the wheat is
continually re-moistening an ever-drying surface&#8212;a
most fertile source of mildew and moulds of several
descriptions.</p>

<p>6. <i>Puccinia fab&aelig;</i> (Bean-rust).<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&#8212;The brown pustular
rust-looking spots on the foliage of beans, and,
indeed, occasionally on the stems and pods of beans,
are sometimes common to this crop. They are
usually accompanied by a lessening both in quantity
and quality of this pulse, both in the garden and in
field culture, but certainly more generally in the
latter. Too gross manuring without well mixing the
dung with the soil would seem to be a constant source
of the evil. In fact, highly nitrogenized manures
appear to favour the development of all this class of
epiphytes, just as too much meat might bring about
different forms of rash or eruptions in the animal.
Weeds, which are too much permitted in beans, here
aid in perfecting the mischief; hence, then, we may
perhaps take it for granted that the mention of the
causes of mischief suggests the remedy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This blight is mentioned here on account of its affinity to the
former.</p></div>

<p>7. <i>&AElig;cidium berberidis</i> (Barberry-rust) is here referred
to, from the opinion prevailing that it is the
cause of rust and mildew in wheat. We can no more
believe that the barberry-rust would produce rust in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
wheat, than the rust of any other plant would do so;
for nearly all plants are affected with some kind or
other of rust. This epiphyte, too, is very different in
structure from wheat-rust. Still, that wheat growing
under a barberry hedge may be more blighted than
in the rest of the field is quite true; and so it is with
wheat grown under any kind of hedge. High fences
are known to favour wheat blights; open, exposed,
well-cultivated positions, when not too elevated, and
without trees or hedges, being those in which the
best wheats are grown.</p>

<p>8. <i>Cladosporium herbarum</i> (Corn-ear Mould) is a
brown-coloured mildew, mostly occurring on the exterior
of the chaff-scales of wheat, but common to
many plants in a state of decadence. It consists of
greenish or blackish tufts, which appear on the outside
of the chaff-scales of wheat under the two following
conditions:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>On wet soils, where the ears appear to have been
prematurely starved.</p>

<p>On dry sands, where long-continued drought has
caused some ears to wither and die before the seed
was fully formed.</p>

<p>In both these cases we see that the plant has been
previously injured. The decay commences under
alternations of moisture and drying, and hence the
fungoid attack. Here, then, the conditions necessary
for preventing will be deep cultivation and a due
pulverization and mixture of the soils.</p>

<p>9-12. <i>Botrytis</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> (Mildew).&#8212;Under this head we
include a multitude of epiphytes, to which the terms
mildew, mealdew, mehlthau (Germ.) are applicable.
They appear to the naked eye as patches of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
dust or meal on the leaves and stems of the affected
plants. With the microscope we see that they are
beautifully-organized plants, having a kind of rootlet
(mycelium) or spawn entering the tissues of the
living plants on which they grow, and delicate pedicels
supporting spores at the externally visible portion
of the plant. The botrytis of the potato and
turnip, the erysiphe or o&iuml;dium of the hop, vine, and
other plants, are only different forms of mildew, which
in some shape or another will be found on most
plants. That these attack living tissues is quite certain;
but in the case of the potato, the turnip, and
the vine, there is reason to believe that they result,
to a very considerable extent, from diseased action
in their tissues. For example: the botrytis of the
potato seems to attack a crop much over-cultivated,
on the approach of wet and cold nights after a prosperous
growth in warm sunshine. So, the o&iuml;dium
seems to us to be most abundant on renewed growth
after a season of dry weather. Again: mildew in
turnips is sure to follow that check which a long
season of dry weather brings after a prosperous and
vigorous growth. All these circumstances at least
show how these attacks are favoured by the conditions
which bring disease. So much, indeed, is this
the case, that we found, upon experimenting with
some cucumbers in a warm stove, that as long as we
regularly watered the plants and gave them the requisite
air, they kept healthy; but, by neglecting
these conditions for a few days, we obtained mildew
with the greatest certainty.</p>

<p>The remedies against mildew are&#8212;to obtain as
healthy a growth as possible, and to maintain this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
with as great regularity as circumstances will permit.
Of late years, both the mildew of the vine and the
hop have been treated with flowers of sulphur. Dusting
the affected hop-leaves with sulphur certainly
arrests the mildew in an incredibly short time; and
we found that by dusting sulphur from a fine sieve
on our cucumber plants, the disease was immediately
arrested in its progress. We therefore look upon this
as an invaluable remedy in these states of mildew,
whether occurring on the vine, the hop, the turnip,
the cucumber, or on other plants, as we have frequently
seen it in hothouses&#8212;a circumstance which
shows the near affinity of all those forms of epiphytes,
which, perhaps, after all, only vary with the variations
in the structure and economy of the different plants
on which they occur.</p>

<p>13. <i>O&iuml;dium abortifaciens</i> (Ergot); <i>Secale cornutum</i>
(Ergot of Rye).&#8212;The black horn-looking spur which
occurs in rye and other grasses was formerly looked
upon as a distinct fungus; now, however, it is known
to be a diseased or malformed condition of the grain
or seed, resulting from an attack by an o&iuml;dium on
the immature seed.</p>

<p>Most of the cereal and even the meadow grasses
are liable to attacks of ergot, which is increased by
cold damp fogs and a moist condition of the atmosphere,
the difference of the size of the spur being in
accordance with the size of the affected grass seed.
Thus, in rye we have seen spurs more than an inch
long, while in the cock&#8217;s-foot grass it is seldom a
quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>The ergot, as it occurs in the rye, is much used by
medical men in difficult cases of parturition; and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
have had evidence before us, in some cases of abortion
in cows, that the constant depasturing on grasses
affected with ergot (and the <i>Lolium perenne</i> in aftermaths
is often especially so) has been the predisposing
cause.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<h4>INSECTS (ANIMAL BLIGHTS) AFFECTING CORN CROPS.</h4>

<p>The different families and species of insects affecting
the various kinds of corn crops in all their stages of
growth are so numerous, that a detailed list of them
would occupy greater space than we can devote to
this chapter.</p>

<p>In this position of affairs we have thought it wise
to confine our remarks to some of the commoner and
more mischievous species, choosing those more particularly
which are common to the wheat crop, of
which the following may be at once introduced as a
summary in itself sufficient to show what the farmer
may expect at each stage of growth:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p>Now, this list may be said to have reference to
eight stages in the growth and preparation of wheat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and they mostly apply to other grains also&#8212;namely,
1. The germinating plant; 2. The growing plant;
3. The growing flower; 4. The green ear of corn;
5. The young grain; 6. The perfected grain; 7. The
stored grain; and 8. In the state of flour.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Slug</i> may be described as a houseless snail.
There are several species, but the milky slug (<i>Limax
agrestis</i>) and the black slug (<i>L. ater</i>) are those most
common to our corn crops, and are more especially
mischievous to wheat; for, as this crop usually succeeds
clover or &#8220;seeds,&#8221; in which they breed most
rapidly, so, the older the clover lea, the more eggs
will be ready to hatch in the wheat crop, and this all
the more readily as the wheat is nearly always put in
with a single ploughing, and with as little cultivation
as possible.</p>

<p>The best remedy will be found in encouraging
insectivorous birds&#8212;the lark, rook, starling, peewit,
and others, eating them either in the egg or young
state with great avidity; a good assistance to whose
labours may be supplied in a few broods of ducks
from the farmyard, which it will pay well to have
tended by a good boy&#8212;where such can be found&#8212;as
these birds are most efficient as destroyers of slugs
and caterpillars.</p>

<p>Store pigs turned into old leas, where they can do
no mischief, will get no bad living where snails and
insects abound.</p>

<p><i>Wire-worms.</i>&#8212;The several species of beetle which
produce the wire-worm belong to the genus <i>Elater</i>.
They are of a long oval shape: about half the length
belongs to the head and thorax, and the other to
the abdomen. Every schoolboy knows that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he holds the insect on its back it elevates the abdominal
portion, and again lets it fall so as to make a
beating sound; and hence its generic name, and also
its common name of click-and-hammer beetle. If he
remove his finger when in this position, the creature
immediately skips up and turns on its feet, from
which action it has got the name of &#8220;skipjack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curtis has estimated nearly seventy species of
click-beetles as producing wire-worms in this country;
but the three following are those generally met
with&#8212;<i>Elater lineatus</i>, <i>E. obscurus</i>, and <i>E. ruficaudis</i>.
These all attack corn and almost every other
kind of vegetable.</p>

<p>The larv&aelig; of these are very much alike, being hard,
leathery, wiry caterpillars, which vary in length to
about three-quarters of an inch, according to age.
These are mostly smooth, and have six feet on their
thoracic segments, and a false foot or <i>proleg</i> in the
middle of the underpart of the terminal section of
the abdomen&#8212;characters by which wire-worms may
be distinguished from all others. Their length varies
with age; as they live for some years in the larva
state, so the different sizes mark so many broods,
which in some fields are annually provided for. It
should here be observed that the wire-worm does
not breed; these larv&aelig; can only be hatched from the
eggs of the female click-beetle: hence, then, destroying
the worms prevents the development of their
parent.</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen whole fields of wheat destroyed
by wire-worms, it becomes important to
examine the nature of this attack, with a view to
point out a remedy. If, then, we go into a corn field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in early spring, and see the young wheat blades looking
yellow and sickly, we shall seldom be long in
finding the wire-worm, on carefully taking up some
of the affected plants. Its position will be at the base
of the plant, sometimes eating its way into its centre,
and so eating out its very heart; or perhaps it may
nibble away the outer coat of the young stem, and so
prevent any nutriment passing into the blade. One
worm will be enough to kill a single blade; but, alas!
it frequently happens that he either visits all the
blades, or is assisted by many individuals to each
plant. This abundance we have observed more particularly
on the breaking up of old pastures, old seeds,
or saintfoin <i>lea</i>, in which not only have we many
broods of wire-worms, but the eggs of a fresh lot,
which hatch in time to eat the spring wheats. Again,
this large increase we have ever observed in districts
where rooks are few or much molested. The rook is a
constant visitor to the clover field; but when the plant
is young he is driven off, because the farmer &#8220;cannot
think what else he can come for but the clover buds;&#8221;
and when he sees some of these strewing the ground
where the birds have been, he is confirmed in his
opinion: but, if he carefully looked at the buds
themselves, he would find them of a sickly hue, however
recent the attack, and, if he looked deeper he
might find the real enemy.</p>

<p>Fortified, then, with repeated observations of this
kind, if asked how best to keep under wire-worms,
we say most unhesitatingly, encourage the rook: he
is one of the farmer&#8217;s best labourers; and though, like
John, and Dick, and Hodge, he will sometimes run
into mischief, it is surely better to institute a judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
police than to condemn and execute without
very strong evidence.</p>

<p>Yarrell, in his beautiful &#8220;British Birds,&#8221; has the
following remarks upon this highly-important subject:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The attempts occasionally made by man to interfere with the
balance of powers as arranged and sustained by Nature, are seldom
successful. An extensive experiment appears to have been made in
some of the agricultural districts on the Continent, the result of
which has been the opinion that farmers do wrong in destroying
rooks, jays, sparrows, and, indeed, birds in general on their farms,
particularly where there are orchards. In our own country, particularly
on some very large farms in Devonshire, the proprietors determined,
a few summers ago, to try the result of offering a great
reward for heads of rooks; but the issue proved destructive to
the farms, for nearly the whole of the crops failed for three successive
years, and they have since been forced to import rooks and
other birds to stock their farms with. A similar experiment was
made a few years ago in a northern county, particularly in reference
to rooks, but with no better success; the farmers were obliged to
reinstate the rooks to save their crops.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>But as, perhaps, the most interesting account of
the value of rooks will be found in an extract from
the <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>, vol. vi. p. 142, we
cannot do better than transcribe it:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>&#8220;In the neighbourhood of my native place (in the county of York),&#8221;
says the writer, Mr. T. Clithero, &#8220;is a rookery belonging to W. Vavasour,
Esq., of Weston, in Wharfdale, in which it is estimated that
there are 10,000 rooks; that 1 lb. of food a week is a very moderate
allowance for each bird, and that nine-tenths of their food consists of
worms, insects, and their larv&aelig;; for, although they do considerable
damage to the fields for a few weeks in seed-time, and a few weeks
in harvest, particularly in backward seasons, yet a very large proportion
of their food, even at these seasons, consists of insects and worms,
which (if we except a few acorns and walnuts in autumn) compose at
all other times the whole of their subsistence. Here, then, if my data<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
be correct, there is the enormous quantity of 468,000 lb., or 209 tons,
of worms, insects, and their larv&aelig;, destroyed by the rooks of a single
rookery in one year. To everyone who knows how very destructive
to vegetation are the larv&aelig; of the tribes of insects, as well as worms,
fed upon by rooks, some slight idea may be formed of the devastation
which rooks are the means of preventing.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let this, then, suffice for the rooks; but starlings,
wagtails, larks, and other birds, are also helpmates to
the farmer; and therefore the wanton destruction of
these will certainly bring, nay, has already brought,
a great amount of trouble upon the cultivator of the
soil.</p>

<p>The destruction we speak of has been committed
by clubs and societies established for the purpose;
but, as their members are mostly filled up with all
sorts of prejudices&#8212;few being naturalists, or even accurate
observers&#8212;it becomes daily a matter of more
pressing importance that middle-class education, if
not National-school teaching, should recognise the
value of the natural sciences.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Gout-fly</i> (<i>Chlorops glabra</i>) and the <i>Saw-fly</i>
(<i>Sirex pygm&aelig;us</i>) both lay their eggs below the first
node or knot of the young plant, which, as soon as
they hatch, form maggots that eat out the substance
of the stems and the nodes, which thus become weakened
and ultimately break off, or, if left standing, the
ears of corn as they appear will be dried, whitened,
and infertile.</p>

<p>In these, as in most cases of insect attacks, we
have an occasional blight of such extent as to destroy
whole crops, against which we are almost powerless,
as we know so little of the economy of the creatures
by whom the mischief is caused; still, there can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
little doubt but that their periodical appearance, to
the extent to cause them to be recognised as <i>blights</i>,
is due to the thinning of their enemies; and we have
always observed that a paucity of the <i>Hirundines</i>&#8212;the
swallow tribe of birds, their greatest enemies&#8212;is
coupled with a great increase of the smaller insects
which it is the vocation of swallows, bats, and others
of the hawking insectivorous creatures, to take on the
wing.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Wheat-midge</i> (<i>Cecidomyia tritici</i>), also called
the Hessian-fly, is sometimes very destructive to the
wheat crop. In 1860 we observed the effects of this
creature to a greater extent than we have before
known, in not a few instances rendering the crop
scarcely worth reaping. Upon this creature we sent
the following notice to the <i>Agricultural Gazette</i> for
August 30, 1862:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The wheat-midge (<i>Cecidomyia tritici</i>) has been so destructive for
the last two or three years, that every fact connected with its history
ought to be of great interest. Curtis tells us that &#8220;in Scotland one-third
of the crop was lost, and the farmers suffered severely in 1828 and the
three following years;&#8221; whilst &#8220;in Suffolk the yield<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of wheat was
one-third less in some districts in 1841 than was expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>The presence or absence of this insect is so important as affecting
the yield, that we now never fail to look for it in every crop upon
which we would offer a judgment in this respect.</p>

<p>It is easily detected in the larva state on opening some of the chaff-scales&#8212;pales&#8212;of
affected crops, as in the interior of these will be
found some minute larv&aelig; (maggots) of a bright yellow or orange colour.
In the earlier period of the blossom these larv&aelig; will be found about the<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
stamens and pistils; later, upon the grain, which is always shrivelled
and lost where the attack has been made.</p>

<p>The colour of the maggots is so much like that of the red-rust as
often to be mistaken for it; the difference, however, between the
bunches of minute granular fungi and living worms will be made
apparent to the most careless observer by the assistance of a common
pocket lens. We find two terms in use for these yellow appearances&#8212;namely,
red-rust and red-gum; and as we have so often found them
employed indiscriminately, we would restrict the former to the
fungus,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> thus&#8212;<i>Uredo rubigo</i>, red-rust; and <i>Cecidomyia tritici</i>, red-gum.
Our observations on the latter this year have chiefly been
made in the counties of Sussex and Gloucester, in both of which we
have seen this insidious enemy at work to an alarming extent. In
the former county, with a very limited extent of red-rust; in the
latter, the later and more delicate wheats have both red-rust and
red-gum in the same crop: and the interest of the subject will be the
more forcibly apprehended when we say that in some crops, which,
from a first glance at the straw and ears, we should have put down
as somewhere about thirty bushels per acre, we have, after a more
minute inspection of the ears, estimated at less than twenty bushels;
and, indeed, in one field which we have examined during the last
week (August, 1862), affected by the <i>Cladosporium</i>, <i>Uredo</i>, and
<i>Cecidomyia</i>, there will scarcely be a yield in good grains of the
amount of the seed sown.</p>

</blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> We believe this creature to be one of the most common causes of
deficient yield, so that a knowledge of its history is all-important in
estimating the value of a crop, which, as a rule, we should always put
lower in the seasons when this blight abounds.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> See <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_185">p. 185</a>.</p></div>

<p>The fly which lays the eggs from which these
yellow larv&aelig; are derived is of about the size of a
gnat, and usually takes the wing in the evening, in
which case, if its enemies the bats are not numerous,
smother fires lighted towards sundown on
the wind side of the fields are not only destructive to
large numbers, but act as an offensive notice to quit
to others. Curtis says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>With regard to the Hessian-fly, even if its presence could be ascertained
in the early stages, it does not seem possible to devise any<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
means of destroying the eggs or young larv&aelig;, unless feeding off the
blade with sheep would effect the object; and when their progress
is detected by their mischievous works, at a more advanced period,
nothing, I apprehend, but sacrificing the crop would arrest them. It
appears, therefore, to be an evil to which we must occasionally
submit; but, to guard against its immediate recurrence, it will only
be necessary to collect and burn the stubble after the corn is reaped,
by which means the larv&aelig; and pup&aelig; which are concealed at the base
of the stalk will, of course, be destroyed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, in reference to wheat stubbles, we would remark
that the old-fashioned plan of leaving them long
as a protection, and, we may add, a preserve of food
for partridges, had its good effects in an agricultural
point of view; but if this be done, we advocate the
burning of the stubs on the soil, as they will thus act
better as a manure, while the destruction of insects
by the process must be enormous. All concur that
modern agriculture suffers increasingly from insects;
hence, then, an extended study of their habits seems
daily more desirable: and we boldly assert that if
our country schoolmasters would teach their pupils
to observe insect life, they may be doing more good
to agriculture than all our present so-called agricultural
colleges and schools put together.</p>

<p>4. The <i>Aphis flea</i> (<i>Aphis granaria</i>) is a creature
destructive to the grain by &#8220;sucking the verdure
out on&#8217;t.&#8221; We have this year (1864) seen this insect,
more especially the <i>apterous</i>&#8212;wingless&#8212;females,
sticking on to the green wheat ears to such an extent
as to render a walk into the crop a disgustingly dirty
process. It would seem that a continuous dry and
warm season favours the increase of these creatures;
but, as we have always observed that the earlier
sown wheats nearly always escape, from their coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
into ear and advancing to ripeness before the aphis
has increased its countless broods; so then we should
recommend early wheat sowing, wherever and whenever
practicable, as a preventive of the pest; in fact,
the being in good time with all farm work has every
advantage.</p>

<p>5. The two affections of the grain in our table are
widely different in their modes of attack, but both
tend to lessen the quantity of produce. The first, the
Ear-Cockle (<i>Vitrio tritici</i>) is an affection of the grain,
which at starting it will be well to distinguish from
smut or bunt. In the latter, the grain is filled with
what appears a black powder, the grains of which the
microscope shows to be a fungus;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> whilst in the
cockle the seed, which is purple externally&#8212;hence
called &#8220;purples&#8221;&#8212;is filled with what appears to be
white cotton wool. This, under the microscope, has
the appearance of a multitude of eels. These are,
indeed, minute infusorial worms, and are exceedingly
curious; the smallest portion of the cottony substance
taken on a pin&#8217;s point and just moistened with water,
often showing thousands of the eels under a good instrument;
for drawings and descriptions of which and
good drawings (after Bauer), we should recommend
the reader to consult &#8220;Curtis&#8217;s Farm Insects.&#8221; A
damp season favours the production of these; hence
drainage and such conditions as increase the effects
of damp and cold are to be guarded against.</p>

<p>The <i>Corn Moth</i> is best known by the presence of a
small, slightly hairy maggot, which is found to eat
the flour from the grain; this is the larva of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
moth, probably the <i>Butalis cerealella</i>. It is easily
found in the chaff scales; and during the summer of
1861 we saw as many as six in a single ear, and it
was, indeed, one of the causes of the bad yield of that
year. We know of no remedy for this evil; but,
perhaps, if we were better acquainted with the
habits of the moth itself, means might be devised
for taking it before the eggs are laid in the young ear
of corn.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Corn or Granary Weevil</i> (<i>Calandra granaria</i>)
and others.&#8212;These attack corn in store, and
probably differ in species according to the kind of
corn. This is a small beetle, the female of which
makes a hole in the grain and deposits an egg, which
soon hatches into the maggot; this eats out the grain
with great assiduity until its partial period of rest in
the pupa state; which passed, the beetle finishes the
work, and may frequently be found in the interior of
wheat.</p>

<p>The usual structures of granaries and corn-stores
contribute to the increase of this pest, as they are
mostly dark and ill-ventilated chambers. The best
remedy is to expose the grain to the greatest possible
amount of cold, by spreading it on the floors in hard
frosts, and letting in light and air. Curtis quotes the
&#8220;Bulletin des Sciences Agriculture&#8221; for July, 1826,
for the following plan:&#8212;&#8220;Lay fleeces of wool, which
have not been scoured, on the grain; the oily matter
attracts the insects amongst the wool, where they
soon die, from what cause is not exactly known.
M. B. C. Payrandeau related to the Philomatic Society
of Paris that his father had made the discovery
in 1811, and had since practised it on a large scale.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>7. The moth that visits granaries (<i>Tinia granella</i>)
may here be adverted to. The presence of the larv&aelig;
of the little grain moth may soon be ascertained in
the granary, when one finds several grains of corn
united by a web, to which will be attached bunches
of small granules, which are the exuvi&aelig; of the
one or two caterpillars belonging to each group of
corns.</p>

<p>The best method of preventing this is thorough
cleanliness, light, and ventilation in the granary. If,
however, the moth has got possession, then we recommend
sulphur to be burnt in iron pans&#8212;old saucepan
lids are as good as anything&#8212;stopping up all the crevices.
This will be an effectual remedy, not only for
the moth, but for the weevils and other insect pests;
and if a pound of sulphur be occasionally burnt in
the barn, even rats must succumb to the gas which
is generated.</p>

<p>8. The <i>Meal-worm Beetle</i> (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>), which
generates commonly in the meal-bins of this country,
and the <i>T. obscurus</i>, which has been introduced in
American flour, are two forms of beetle, the larv&aelig; of
which are &#8220;meal-worms.&#8221; These are best prevented
by not keeping too large a store of flour, always
having this dry and in the best condition, and storing,
as far as possible, in a clean, light, and airy position.
Indeed, as Curtis remarks, &#8220;Cleanliness is the best
guard against these insects;&#8221; and we cannot better
conclude this chapter than by further quoting the
following from this excellent author:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>In looking back to the variety of insects that feed upon corn, and
the multitudes that are often congregated in one heap, there can be
no doubt that a very large portion must be occasionally ground up<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with the corn and consumed by the public. This is not only a disagreeable
fact, but it may be the source of very serious consequences,
for I think it not improbable that many diseases might be traced to
the insects which are converted with the infested flour into bread,
amounting to such a large percentage, that if they have the slightest
medicinal or deleterious qualities, it is impossible to deny the influence
they must exercise upon the human system. I have known
bushels of cocoa-nuts, which were every one worm-eaten and full of
maggots, with their webs, excrement, cast-off skins, pup&aelig;, and cocoons,
all ground down to make chocolate, flavoured, I suppose, with
vanilla!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>

<h4>SCIENCE IN THE CULTIVATION OF CORN.</h4>

<p>The object of the present chapter will be to point
out the principles concerned in the more immediate
acts connected with the cultivation of corn. In so
doing in the present case, as in the discussion of
the preceding subjects, it may not be out of place
here to state that it has not, nor will it be, our
object to enter into the every-day practical details
of crop-management, but to dwell more particularly
upon those points in cultivation which may be
said to belong more especially to the science of the
subject.</p>

<p>This chapter, then, will be more especially
devoted to the consideration of the three following
subjects:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>1st. On the uses of special manures for corn crops.<br />

2nd. On the quality and quantity of corn to be
used for seed.<br />

3rd. On the period for harvesting corn.</p>

<p>1st. <i>On the Uses of Manures.</i>&#8212;It is pretty generally
agreed that special manuring for corn, when
grown in the ordinary shifting crop system, is positively
injurious, and more truly so, if farmyard dung
be employed. Still, on our own farm we were over-persuaded
to give a dressing of rotted dung to some
wheat. As the previous crop, turnips, had all but
failed, we yielded on being told that it was a common
Dorset custom, but, fortunately, only to the extent
of a few acres down the middle of the field, on which
part, at harvest, the main of the crop had fallen to
the ground, with the affection known as knee-bent.
There was plenty of straw, not at all good; but the
yield of plump grains can hardly be half of those of
the other parts of the field.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we have never observed special
manuring to be useful except as top-dressings in
early spring, at which time soot, or, better still, a
mixture of soot and guano, may be sown on most
wheat crops to advantage, and more especially where
the young plant has been injured by the slug or the
wire-worm, as in these cases the lower joint and the
winter root are destroyed. If, then, the young plant
be at this time stimulated with the mixture as advised,
and the crop be afterwards rolled, we supply
nutriment just in the form that it can be readily
assimilated, the injured plants send out new roots
from the second joint, and begin a fresh life, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the uninjured ones push out new buds&#8212;<i>stolons</i>&#8212;and
all grow the better, because the roller has aided in
firmly fixing the plants in the ground.</p>

<p>There have been those who would tell us that manure
can be best used to wheat by subjecting the seed
to various steeps; but we need hardly stop to question
the folly of the assertions which from time to time
re-appear, both at home and abroad, upon this point.</p>

<p>Thus far the subject of manures has been treated
as for wheat as a shifting crop; but this crop has
been grown year after year on the same soil, and, in
some cases, without an apparent diminution in quantity
or quality. One instance that came under our
own observation was in Gloucestershire, where a cottager
had grown wheat on the same plot of ground
for thirteen years, and, for aught I know, it may still
be continued. Hence the subsoil was <i>Lias shale</i>; but
it was well drained and cultivated as a garden, the
manure employed being the contents of the garden-house.</p>

<p>In cases of this kind, an annual application of
manure is absolutely necessary; and we are happy to
find that different manures and their effects have
been experimented upon and duly noted, <i>for the same
plots</i>, during a period of no less than twenty years,
and that by such careful and reliable inquirers as
J. B. Lawes, Esq., F.R.S., and Dr. Gilbert, F.R.S.;
full details of the results of whose labours upon this
subject will be found in Vol. XXV. of the <i>Journal
of the Royal Agricultural Society of England</i>, from
which we have extracted some of the following general
conclusions as to average yield and weight of
corn for the lengthened periods quoted:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>A glance at this table shows us the wonderful results
of <i>continuous</i> manuring for the soil operated
upon; we might, however, expect that, though the
general conclusions would probably not greatly vary,
yet that there would not be absolute uniformity in
these respects in different soils and districts.</p>

<p>2. <i>On the Quality and Quantity of Seed-corn.</i>&#8212;It
seems to be generally concluded that a thin seed,
from poorer soil, should be preferred for land of a
better quality; but our own experience would lead us
to look for seed from as great a change of soil as possible,
and to procure therefrom not a poor, but as good
a sample as we could. We should, however, look for
our seed, not from a richer soil or a warmer climate,
but the reverse. Oats, for example, as previously
shown, degenerate, even to wild ones, if the poor seed
be brought from a poor, cold soil, to be cultivated in
land still poorer. We, however, on our farm, sowed
oats during the past season weighing 48 lb. per bushel
on a sandy soil; and, although our return was not so
large in bushels as though we had sown black oats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
yet their weight was but just under that of the seed.
Now, these oats were from Canada, and, no doubt,
the warm climate of the west of England suited them
as to change.</p>

<p>As regards barley, we prefer a good sample for
seed, if it be of home-growth; at the same time, very
thin samples from Russia, or the States, often do
well. Last season, we sowed some American barley
of so poor a quality, that it was impossible to tell its
name, but which gave for 50 acres an average yield
of 40 bushels per acre, so even and plump, that only
28 sacks of &#8220;tailing&#8221; were separated, and the bulk&#8212;good
Chevallier barley&#8212;was equal to any in the
market.</p>

<p>In cultivating wheat, climate must ever be considered,
as only in warm situations can the finest samples
of white wheats be grown. Upland cold positions
are suitable for red wheats, and so are undrained lowlands;
still, good farming will render it possible to
grow white wheats where, before drainage and other
ameliorating processes, such was impossible.</p>

<p>As regards the quantity to be sown per acre, it will
be seen that the margin is sufficiently wide, if we say
that it lies between half a peck and half a quarter.
In garden cultivation, with deep digging, and in
the absence of weeds, birds, or insects, where you
can choose your time for every operation, dibble in
a seed in a place, the minimum quantity may
suffice, as good crops have been got from a very small
quantity of seed; but garden experimenters rather
too positively lay down the law, when they tell the
farmer that this thin seeding will do equally well on
broad acres, where every operation is circumscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
by circumstances. Where there is so much to do,
you cannot always get everything done at the right
season, even if the soil were favourable for so doing;
and the period at which you get your land ready for
the seed, and the time of sowing it, makes a wide
difference. But there is another point of even&#8212;if
possible&#8212;greater importance; namely, the <i>quality</i> of
the seed. Now, on our farm we always ascertain the
germinating power of every sample of seed before
sowing; and from this, as well as from the results of
numerous experiments on this subject, we have arrived
at the conclusion, that there are immense
differences in this respect, which cannot possibly
be made out at sight, but can only be ascertained
experimentally. To make this matter clear, we
append a <a href="#TableXXX_2">table (2)</a> of the results of experiments on
this point upon no less than forty-two samples, which
were tried in 1863.</p>

<p>Now, these experiments showed a want of germinating
power, in some of the samples, of more than
50 per cent., and in the 42 samples an average of
24.5 per cent.; from which it will be seen that sometimes
the thick sower is not the thick seeder, and his
failure of a crop is not always due to slugs and wireworms.</p>

<p>These experiments were published in the <i>Agricultural
Gazette</i>, and they evoked some remarks from a
learned divine, so unfair and uncandid, as only to be
excused by the nature of his professional education
and modes of thought. Now, when this gentleman
affected to believe that these things could not be so,
and that with him every seed germinated, we could
only conclude that the days of miracles had not quite
ceased; but as, in later numbers of the <i>Gazette</i>, his
opinions have been somewhat modified in this respect,
we yet think him capable of riding a hobby
too hard, though not until the pace has thrown him
down and broken his knees will he own it.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that there were such variations in the
germinating powers of wheat, we determined to try a
series of experiments with barley; and from the
results (<a href="#TableXXX_3">table 3</a>), it will be seen that, though the
margin is not so wide, yet great differences occur;
still, with regard to this grain, we constantly find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
that in samples too thin and poor for even the farmyard
poultry to pick up, yet that much of this is
capable of germination.</p>

<p>Still, theory and practice confirm the assumption
that in England very much seed is wasted by being
too thickly sown; and, if a farmer can get his land
well prepared and in good time, we conclude, as a
matter of practical experience, that just half the seed
usually sown will be better than the double quantity;
but we should, as a rule, make a difference of at least
half a peck for each week that we were beyond the
best time of wheat-sowing in any particular district.
On our own farm we sowed four and six pecks of
wheat where double the quantity had been the rule
before Christmas, and from six to eight pecks afterwards;
six pecks of barley and oats, where a sack had
previously been the rule. With the wheat and barley
we were right, except in the very late-sown of the
latter, when time was only sufficient to grow a single
head, and not to allow of stooling. Here a sack
would have given a better result. The same with our
oats: thin seeding caused them to run to straw; they
were on a poor sand, taller than the men who cut
them; but had we doubled our seed, we conclude we
should have had shorter straw and more corn.</p>

<p>If, then, these things be so, the judgment of the
farmer will be best shown in rightly weighing <i>all</i> the
circumstances of his case; and in the matter of seeding,
as with physic, he will find that hom&#339;opathy
<i>alone</i> is only quackery.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<h4>ON HARVESTING CORN.</h4>

<p>A knowledge of when corn is in the best condition
to be harvested is a matter of great importance; and
hence some observations upon this subject may fitly
conclude this part of our work.</p>

<p>Not to enter too deeply into chemical matters, we
may state, at least as a probable general conclusion,
that there is a period in the growth of grain and
pulse crops before they are ripe, in which all the
feeding qualities will be found diffused in the several
plants; a little later, and the feeding matters will be
found more particularly concentrated in the seed.
Now, if oats, peas, and beans, be cut in this &#8220;green&#8221;
state, they make either a fresh food, or can be dried
into hay, which, when cut into chaff, is found to be
an excellent feeding material; and as such crops can
be quickly cleared and cheaply employed, there is no
doubt but that they will henceforward be more generally
used in this way than formerly.</p>

<p>But, again, in ripening of wheat there would appear
to be a point in its progress short of &#8220;dead ripe,&#8221; in
which every quality is fully stored in the seed; and,
after this period, the seed-covering becomes thicker,
and makes more bran in proportion to flour: facts
made out from the following results of experiments
of samples in three different states:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Now, this shows that although the medium ripe
ears in sample 2 had a less number of grains, yet their
per-centage of flour, as compared with bran, was
greatly on the increase. Still, it will be seen that
sample 3 has the advantage in measure: hence, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
unless the miller will agree to give a better price for
a &#8220;gay&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> sample, it will be to the farmer&#8217;s advantage
to leave it to fully ripen, if he can make sure that it
can be kept from shedding in harvesting, and the
attacks of birds.</p>

West of England.</p></div>

<p>As regards barley, if our crop is required for home
use for feeding purposes, we should cut at least a
week earlier than most people, and we should have as
good feeding quality, without loss from winds, loss in
harvesting, and from birds; but, if our land grows
malting barley, the sample will be a better, and more
uniform in germinating, when &#8220;dead ripe.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the last season (1864), our pupil, F. Witts,
Esq., collected bunches of corn from a crop of fine
white oats at the under-mentioned dates. From these
we counted 500 seeds, and took their weights; and,
though we confess that many such experiments will
be required to settle the whole facts of the case, yet
the results given in <a href="#TableXXXI_6">table 6</a> are so curious, that we
hope in future to direct our pupils in carrying out
many similar experiments.</p>

<p>The two samples, each of the 20th and 21st,
were probably obtained from different parts of the
same field, yet they lead us to conclude, as do those of
the other dates, that a single day, if a hot summer,
makes a great deal of difference. Now, the crop
was not cut until a week after the 21st, and yet we
are persuaded that we should have gained by cutting
on the 20th rather than later, and, at least, we should
have prevented much loss from &#8220;shed&#8221; seeds.</p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD FENCES.</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE NATURE OF FENCES.</h4>

<p>Fences, as boundary lines to estates and as a means
of dividing and separating land into convenient parts
or fields, are worthy of greater attention than we
think is paid to them either by the landlord or the
tenant.</p>

<p>But it is perhaps the fact that the landlord on the
one hand too often looks upon them as mere boundaries,
or deems that he is only personally concerned
in them to that extent; while the tenant on the other
hand&#8212;and especially if his holding be precarious&#8212;can
hardly be expected to take that care and defray those
expenses which growing good fences and keeping
them in order must necessarily entail. In treating
this subject, then, we shall endeavour to show that
the study of how to grow good fences, by putting the
matter upon correct principles, will tend to the good
of all parties concerned.</p>

<p>Fences are of two well-known types: <i>Dead fences</i>,
such as the natural boundaries of streams, artificial
ditches, raised mounds, walls, railings, &amp;c.; <i>Live</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
<i>fences</i>, grown from living trees or shrubs. These
latter, then, as forming no unimportant part of farm
cultivation, will occupy our attention in the next
few chapters.</p>

<p>With regard to dead fences, those in more general
farm use may be briefly described under the heads of
railings, mounds, and stone walls.</p>

<p>Railings are of various kinds, according to circumstances;
the simplest form of these consist of
piles driven into the ground at about five feet apart
and secured by split larch on the top, and either larch
cross pieces below or iron hoops. In making these
the landlord usually finds the rough material, the
tenant paying for the work, the usual cost for cutting-out
being a penny for each pile. This kind of fencing
is mostly employed as a protection to young live
fences, or to fill up gaps in older ones.</p>

<p>Mounds are simply lines of raised earthworks, and
are used where stone or fencing materials are expensive,
or where live fences can only be grown with
difficulty. Sometimes these elevations are crowned
with privet or some light hedge-plant. They are
occasionally employed as field boundaries by river
sides, where they subserve the purpose of keeping
out floods, but usually the mound is more used as a
division of property than as a fence.</p>

<p>Stone walls are the commonest fences over miles
of country in the middle of England, the Cotteswold
hills being remarkable for dry stone walls&#8212;the stone
for these &#8220;Oolite freestones&#8221; being well adapted for
the purpose&#8212;of course they are dry, that is, built without
mortar, as this would render the work too costly
for field boundaries. These walls have a wild and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
desolate appearance, but they are commended by some
as not harbouring birds or vermin; but this is a
questionable good, for as regards birds, we contend
that the stone wall districts would be better off if
they afforded shelter for a few more; but stoats, mice,
snails, beetles, and small fry of the kind of no use
whatever, are absolutely protected by the stone wall.</p>

<p>It is said again, that the stone wall offers little
chance for weeds, but to those who have been accustomed
to observe about a yard on either side of a
wall constantly left unploughed and uncleaned, stone
walls will be considered as nurseries and protectors
of weeds, and those, too, of a highly mischievous
character, as couch thistles, docks, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With regard to the couch grass (<i>Triticum repens</i>),
we have traced it running from this source for a
couple of yards into the ploughed field, with the inevitable
consequence that in the furrows it is cut into
convenient lengths to multiply the pest; and it has
been on this account that we have ever been careful
to direct dragging and harrowing to be done in the
direction of the walls, before proceeding with these
operations over the rest of the field, and we recommend
the cutting down of weeds under these walls
before a crop of corn be carried.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE PLANTS FOR &#8220;LIVE&#8221; FENCES.</h4>

<p>The native plants which have been employed for
living fences include most of our indigenous trees
and shrubs, with some few which, if not native, have
yet been for a long time naturalised throughout Great
Britain. The most important of these will be found
in the following list:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p>In the first group, it may be remarked, that oak,
ash, and elm are seldom, if ever, planted for hedges;
for in the first place these plants are usually too expensive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and in the next they are not esteemed as
hedge plants. They mostly find their way in the
fence by seeds being sown by the wind, as is often the
case with ash-keys, or they may start up a bush of
underwood after being cut down as hedge-row timber;
in either case they are very unsightly in appearance,
and far from good in hedges. Trees should not be
grown in hedge-rows where the fence is to be perfect,
as these overshadow the best hedge-plants, and the
sides of the boles always offer weak places.</p>

<p>Beech and hornbeam are frequently used for garden
and smaller fences, and, when well grown, are
really useful as a protection, as their withered leaves
are persistent, that is, they do not fall off until
new ones are formed. They are grown comparatively
quickly, and will flourish in poor light soils,
and if strong plants be made to cross each other in
planting, they may be trained to form a strong fence.</p>

<p>In the second group, the whitethorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus oxyacantha</i>)
stands deservedly at the top of the list; in
fact, it is the very best hedge-row plant we possess. It
is not slow of growth in congenial soil, especially if well
attended to. Its thorns render it thoroughly repellant
to cattle. It bears cutting, clipping, and trimming
better than any other; and though variable in its behaviour
in different soils, it is, after all, capable of
bearing a greater diversity in this respect than any
other of our list. The whitethorn, then, is deservedly
held in the highest repute for the growth of the most
perfect live fence for all ordinary farm purposes; the
blackthorn, crab, and buckthorn being tolerated only
because they possess some of the same characteristics
as the whitethorn. As regards the latter, it is exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
long-lived, and, if left to itself, forms trees of
considerable size, which are occasionally very beautiful
as forming part of park scenery; still in hedges it
can be kept to any size, and cutting it in causes a new
wood to spring up, which has all the characteristics of
a young, quick plant.</p>

<p>These are merits of the greatest importance in
favour of the whitethorn, which will ever make this
the best hedge-row plant, as if we succeed to a whitethorn
fence, which has been trimmed and kept within
due bounds, there is no difficulty in continuing the
process; and so if the hedge be left to grow tall and
wild it may be cut out either wholly or partially,
some stems cut half through&#8212;as in the process of
<i>plashing</i>&#8212;laid down, and so a secure though not so
tall a fence be formed, that will only grow thicker year
by year.</p>

<p>Blackthorn&#8212;sloe (<i>Prunus spinosa</i>) is formidable
enough as regards thorns, but it cannot stand the same
amount of cutting as the whitethorn, and, when cut,
its young shoots being almost thornless, makes a
hedge of the sloe the less repellant the more vigorous
are its shoots.</p>

<p>The crab-apple (<i>Pyrus malus</i>) and the buckthorn
(<i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>) may be considered as accidental
in fences; and as, to a great extent, they
will grow with the quicks and suffer the same
treatment without growing as upstarts on the one
hand, or refusing to start again after crippling
on the other, they are both tolerated in fences
without quite getting a character for being hedgerow
weeds.</p>

<p>The holly (<i>Ilex aquifolium</i>) possesses a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
repellant armour in its spinous, evergreen leaves,
on which, account it is esteemed as a plant for
fences:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A hedge of holly, thieves that would invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repulses like a growing palisade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose numerous leaves such orient greens invest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in deep winter do the spring arrest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is one of our native trees, frequently attaining
to a great size on even wild, stony places, with only
a thin layer of soil. We have seen some fine
examples, large enough to secure the holly a place
among our native forest trees on the &#8220;stony Cotteswolds,&#8221;
as Shakespeare calls the high Gloucestershire
range; it is, however, of slow growth, or it would,
doubtless, be more used for fences: still in poor
soils it will, after all, grow as fast as the whitethorn,
Evelyn is eloquent in praise of holly. He says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object of the
kind than an impregnable hedge of about four hundred feet in
length, nine feet high, and five in diameter, which I can show in my
now ruined gardens at Saye Court (thanks to the Czar of Muscovy<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>),
at any time of the year, glittering with its armed and varnished
leaves? The taller standards, at orderly distances, blushing with
their natural coral; it mocks the rudest assaults of the weather,
beasts, or hedge-breakers,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Et illum nemo impun&egrave; lacessit.<br /></span>

<p>It is with us of two eminent kinds, the prickly and smoother leaved;
or, as some term it, the free holly, not unwelcome, when tender, to
sheep and other cattle. There is also of the white berried, and a<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
golden and silver, variegated in six or seven differences, which proceeds
from no difference in the species, but accidentally, and <i>natur&aelig; lusu</i>,
as most such variegations do, since we are taught how to effect it
artificially, namely by sowing the seeds, and planting in gravelly soil
mixed with store of chalk, pressing it hard down: it being certain
that they return to their native colour when sown in richer mould,
and that all the fibres of the roots recover their natural food.</p>

order that he might be near the yard at Deptford, during his stay in
England; but we do not see why he should be thanked for the holly
hedge.</p></div>

<p>The differences in the colour of the fruit, as of the
colour and shape of the leaves, is truly a matter of
variety. The red-berried holly, under the name of
&#8220;Christmas,&#8221; is quite an article of commerce at the
festive season&#8212;so much so that a friend of ours
in the neighbourhood of Stroud, who this year
(1864-5) had a large tree well covered with berries,
assured us that he had great difficulty in preventing
it going to market with some of the marauders, who
scour the country in search of anything they can
sell.</p>

<p>In the Worcester market we for many years
noticed a sprinkling of white, or, rather, yellowish-berried
holly, a spray or two of which was always
put with the bundle of the red-berried in effecting
the many Christmas sales.</p>

<p>As regards the difference in the leaves, although
it is true that in the gardens we have a smooth and
unarmed variety, however dwarf the specimen may
be, yet in wild examples the smooth leaves will, for
the most part, only be found on the upper parts of
tall trees; the poet, then, has been as true to Nature
as graceful in art in the poem of which the following
lines form a part:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>In growing hedges, the clipping to keep them
within bounds helps to keep the holly spinous at
any age.</p>

<p>Evelyn further descants upon the excellency of
holly for hedges; and as the following remarks are
so truly practical, we quote them in this place:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The holly is an excellent plant for hedges, and would claim the
preference to the hawthorn, were it not for the slowness of its growth
while young, and the difficulty of transplanting it when grown to a
moderate size. It will grow best in cold, stony land, where, if once
it takes well, the hedges may be rendered so close and thick as to
keep out all sorts of animals. These hedges may be raised by sowing
the berries in the place where they are designed to remain, or by
plants of three or four years&#8217; growth; but as the berries continue in
the ground near eighteen months before the plants appear, few
persons care to wait so long; therefore, the usual and best method is
to plant the hedges with plants of the before-mentioned age. But
where this is practised, they should be transplanted either early in
autumn, or deferred till toward the end of March; then the surface
of the ground should be covered with mulch near their roots, after
they are planted, to keep the earth moist; and if the season should
prove dry, the plants should be watered, at least once a-week, until
they have taken root, otherwise they will be in danger of miscarrying,
for which reason the autumnal planting is generally preferred
to the spring, especially in dry grounds. Columella&#8217;s description
of a good hedge is highly applicable to one made of holly,
&#8220;Neu sit pecori, neu pervia furi.&#8221; Of the rind of this tree birdlime
is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>If we except the Privet, the examples of plants in
our third group are quite unfit for hedge purposes, as
they are entirely without offensive armature. Privet
hedges are not unfrequent in gardens, where they
are useful for boundaries, blinds, and to act as shelter,
but as a farm hedge-plant it is quite useless.</p>

<p>The nut, guelder rose, and elder have none of the
qualities for hedge growth that are required by the
former; on the contrary, they have large leaves, and
so smother the quicks if they grow with them, and
when cut they shoot rapidly, especially in the case
of the elder (<i>Sambucus niger</i>), and so make a hedgerow
look ragged by here and there growing a yard or
so above the ordinary hedge-plants; but, besides
this, the lower stems get free from leaves, and hence
gaps are easily made in bushes of nut, dogwood,
elder, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the above description of hedgerow plants we
have omitted all mention of yew, holly, laurustinas,
furze, and the like, as being more properly materials
for ornamental or garden hedges. The furze, however,
is sometimes used on the tops of mounds,
in some sandy districts, as a fence plant, but the
constant dying of the old wood and the consequent
exercise by the cottager of a fancied right to pull
the hedge to pieces for firing render it almost
impossible to employ it to any advantage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<h4>ON THE REARING AND PLANTING OF HEDGES.</h4>

<p>The rearing of plants for hedges is a matter of so
much importance that one can well understand how
it has come to be a business of itself; and as it is
better that it should be so, both landlords and tenants
will do rightly to encourage its being done well. If,
then, we take it for granted that the whitethorn is
the best hedge-plant, it will be best to inquire&#8212;as a
contribution to the science of the subject&#8212;whether
there are not some important varieties of this plant;
if so, we should determine which is the best, and
encourage its cultivation. As the case at present
stands, nurserymen take no pains in the matter; they
usually employ children to collect the &#8220;haws&#8221;&#8212;the
name by which the fruits are known&#8212;and it is a
matter of perfect indifference where or how they
obtain them.</p>

<p>Now, as regards the common hawthorn, experience
has taught us that seeds obtained from trees in cold,
wild, stony places, such as have established themselves
about old quarries on the Cotteswold-hills,
more quickly make good plants than those from the
pampered hedge-row in the deep vale-lands.</p>

<p>But, in addition to this, having some years ago
observed that certain whitethorn-trees came into
flower a full fortnight before others, and this on the
cold forest-marble clays in the exposed country of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
North Wilts and south of Cirencester, we were
induced to examine this tree more closely; and the
result of the inquiry was to induce a belief that
this is a much hardier, quicker, and more certain
growing plant for hedge-rows than the commoner
form.</p>

<p>With these views established in our mind, we were
not a little pleased to find that in the beautiful new
edition of &#8220;English Botany,&#8221; by the accomplished
editor, J. T. Syme, Esq., F.L.S., &amp;c., figures and
descriptions are given of the two forms; and we
here reproduce in opposite columns the descriptions
referred to with a figure of the early form we have
mentioned, that our readers may compare it with the
common whitethorn:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>That the glabrous whitethorn would make the best
hedge-row form we have no doubt, as its free growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and early leafing particularly recommend it; and
besides, though not the commonest, we cannot help
thinking it to be the hardiest variety, and one that
would be likely to succeed in soils where the ordinary
one would be very slow in growth.</p>

<p>We have occasionally met with it in nursery-plantations,
as well as in hedge-rows, where it is
distinguished at a glance by its more freely growing
twigs and brighter coloured, quite smooth leaves;
so also, but more rarely, we have met with the
Glastonbury thorn in the hedge-row, which we look
upon as a variety of the glabrous thorn, a specimen
of which is now before us (January, 1865), with both
leaves and flowers well in bud, in the midst of a deep
snow and a severe frost.</p>

<p>This variety is fabled to have sprung from Joseph
of Arimath&aelig;a&#8217;s staff, which he is supposed to have
planted in the soil at Glastonbury, on Christmas-day,
prior to the foundation of the abbey at that interesting
place; and we have found some natives, both here
and in Herefordshire&#8212;whither perhaps the thorn had
spread with sorts of apples,&#8212;who adduce the budding
of this thorn, which is usually after our present
Christmas-tide, as an evidence that Old Christmas is
the right day.</p>

<p>But we must not be too far led away by the
legendary lore, much less the poetry connected with
the whitethorn.</p>

<p>We come now to a description of the methods to
be observed in planting fences, having taken for
granted that quicks be employed for the purpose, and
that we encourage the production of the sort best
adapted to our purpose,&#8212;an end which, we conceive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
will be well attained by offering prizes to nurserymen
for good and well-grown quicks.</p>

<p>In planting hedges, then, our first care should be
to prepare the ground. This must be done according
to the soil; and here it may be noted that there are
two plans of doing this most commonly used, namely,
raising a mound, on which the quicks are to be
planted without a ditch; and the making a ditch and
planting the quicks on the top of the elevated soil.
Now, curiously enough, the first method is the one
usually adopted in light, porous soils, as on the sands
of Dorsetshire; the second, in porous stones, where
ditches are not required, as in the oolitic districts;
or else in clay soils, where alone the ditch is at all
advisable.</p>

<p>We advise that in light soils, as sandy loams, where
drainage is not required, the ground be well dug
on the flat before the planting of the quicks; that in
thin soils on brashes the brash be loosened; and
then that some soil be carted on this surface, making
an additional thickness of not more than six inches of
soil. As regards the preparation for a fence, by previously
making a ditch, we object to it on account of
the loss of ground; the ditch, again, if forming part
of the system of drainage, is always liable to become
choked by weeds, brambles, and the like, with water-plants
growing in it. Had we to begin the laying-out
of ground, we should make our drainage-system
independent of the fences; and so, however stiff our
clays if well drained, we should as a rule only raise
the soil where a fence was to be planted, by a few
inches.</p>

<p>We speak the more strongly on this matter, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
on our own farm we have fences attempted to be
grown on the top of mounds five feet high, and which
are made out of some of the lightest agricultural
soil in England, so light, indeed, as at first to appear
to be a nearly pure sand. On the same farm, again,
we have yawning ditches in oolitic limestone, which
never carried water; and Mr. Parkes made ditches of
this kind on the College-farm at Cirencester, which
have ever been equally dry. These banks and ditches
are worse than useless in our own case: quicks will
not grow at all; and so the bank is covered with all
kinds of shrubs, mixed with weeds, neither sufficient
to keep in cattle, nor prevent the workmen trespassing
in every direction.</p>

<p>The next subject for consideration is that of the
planting of the quicks. To this end we should choose
our plants to be of about four or five years old; and
in all cases, if possible, should personally superintend
their removal from the nursery. Old bundles of
quicks, that have stood it may be two or three weekly
markets, will be sure to cause disappointment.
They should be removed so as to secure as many
of the rootlets&#8212;not merely the larger roots&#8212;as
possible.</p>

<p>In planting, which should be done as quickly as
may be after removal, avoid the dibble, or anything
which would tend to combine the roots in a small
compass. The best plan is to use the spade and to
spread the roots carefully; then cover them up, and
tread the plants firmly into the ground, taking care,
if it be in a retentive soil, not to leave holes in which
water could stagnate.</p>

<p>When so planted, at about from six to nine inches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
they should annually, or twice a year if necessary, be
hoed and weeded and have the surface-soil tolerably
well stirred, and, usually at the end of about the
third or fourth year, be carefully cut down within six
or eight inches of the ground, and the soil well
stirred and manured. This would appear to be a waste
of time; but a single year will restore the plants to
even a greater height than before, and with all the
elements for a thick impervious bottom, from which
time annual careful trimming&#8212;always when the
leaves have performed their functions and fall off&#8212;will
be sufficient to keep the hedge in an improving
state.</p>

<p>We have here advocated planting in single lines.
Some, however, prefer double rows of quicks; but
the latter are more difficult to keep clean and to
cultivate; and we have ever seen that it is not the
quantity, but the quality and the after-treatment of
the plants which result in the compact and repellant
hedge.</p>

<p>Of course, all young hedges must be protected by a
dead fence; and for this purpose we prefer posts and
rails of wood, or, if to keep back sheep, mixed with a
line or two of hoop-iron: this, according to the
situation of the fence, will be required on only one
or on both sides.</p>

<p>In planting young beech, or hornbeam, or any non-spinous
plant, for hedges, it is advisable to cross the
sets like a series of XXX&#8217;s, overlapping each other at
about ten or twelve inches apart; by this means the
branches interlace, and a compact fence, difficult to
penetrate, will be formed.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>Maple may be used in the same way; but it never
makes a strong fence, and it has not the advantage of
the two former, as its leaves fall off at the approach
of cold weather, which is not the case with either
beech or hornbeam, whose leaves are eminently
persistent, especially in the earlier part of their
lives.</p>

<p>If furze hedges be required for any position, they
may easily be grown, either by taking up young
plants from the waste and planting them where
wanted, or by sowing seed, which can readily be
obtained from any seedsman.</p>

<p>Before sowing, the ground should be lightly dug,
and the seeds, after being soaked for a few hours in
water, be thinly sown, and be only just covered up
by the soil. This operation may be done in February;
and when the seeds come up, if they are covered
over by branches of cut furze, or these be stuck here
and there in, or on, either side of the rows, the young
plants will be protected from cattle and sheep, which
are fond of nibbling the tender furze shoots.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>

<h4>WEEDS OF HEDGE-ROW FENCES.</h4>

<p>As the hawthorn is usually recognized as the best
plant for living fences for farm purposes, it will be
expected that this has been almost exclusively
employed; but, seeing that this is so, and has been
so for many years past, it is not a little interesting
to trace in all hedges a predilection to grow anything
else rather than that originally planted. Of
course, with anything else we wished to grow, such
interlopers would be eradicated as weeds; but with
hedges it would seem that all kinds of rubbish are
left to accumulate, until a hedge originally all hawthorn
has become made up of extraneous matters, with
occasional &#8220;gaps,&#8221; which are sure to occur where
other plants are allowed, to the prejudice of the
quicks. As examples, we append the following:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>These three examples will be sufficient to show
the fact that, in the lapse of years, a hedge originally
planted either all or nearly all quicks, ultimately
contains almost everything besides. How this comes
about may be easily observed. Birds and other creatures
are constantly taking fruits of various plants
to the hedge-rows, the seeds of which being dropped
there, soon vegetate; and if shrubs with heavier
twigs and broader leaves once ascend into the hedge,
they overshadow the smaller leaves of the quicks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and ultimately so discourage them that they all but
die out, and it is not at all difficult to see that the
success of the interlopers is only augmented by the
injuries to the quicks.</p>

<p>A more minute inquiry into the natural history
and mode of operation of hedge-row weeds will be
best preceded by a list of such plants as may be
considered to act as weeds in a properly planted
whitethorn hedge.</p>

<p>In doing this we may premise that, if our object has
been to plant quicks, interlopers of all kinds, whether
trees or shrubs&#8212;in fact, all but the plant which
we have purchased and planted&#8212;can scarcely be
considered other than as weeds. To these interlopers,
then, we may add the following list, as
containing a series of plants that will be, perhaps,
more generally recognized as weeds:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>As regards the plants of this list, it will only be
necessary to refer to a few of them, in order the
more fully to impress the principles we have laid
down.</p>

<p>The roses (briars) and brambles, though spinous,
are yet short-lived; so that their old wood is continually
dying out, thus causing gaps, inasmuch
as such heavily-foliaged plants necessarily prevent
the growth of the whitethorn or any other tolerable
hedge-plant. But, besides this, the bramble has the
propensity to root at the ends of its long flexile
branches, and so spreads the pest in every direction,
not escaping the ditch when it forms part of the
fence, that the whole becomes smothered up in a
tangled, inextricable mass, always out of order and
unsightly, making but a poor fence, though affording
shelter to hares, rabbits, and other farm pests.</p>

<p>The clematis and ivy are large-foliaged plants, and
their pliant stems interlace on the hedge in such a
manner as most surely to kill out the quicks, and so
to become the usurping tenants; but, no sooner have
they attained the mastery than they begin to decay,
whole branches die, and the result is a gap, which
must either be patched up with thorns or be newly
planted, and then fenced with post and rails. As
regards mending gaps with thorns, we ought to
state that we view it as decidedly injurious,&#8212;as dead
matter in proximity with the living only prevents
the growth of the latter: at best it is only a
makeshift, which soon gets rotten, and tempts the
petty wood-pilferer to pull the hedge further to
pieces for the sake of a few dry sticks.</p>

<p>With regard to those plants of which we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
take the bryony and the hop as the types, it is true
that their bine is annual; but each year the quantity
and strength of this augments&#8212;each year the mass
of foliage becomes larger and thicker. The twining
arms twist around any branch strong enough to
support them, and then, once at the top of the fence,
they spread over its surface, making so thick a mass
that the legitimate hedge-plants are no longer
visible; thus sun and air are excluded from them,
and they soon pine away. These are difficult to eradicate,
as they have stout rhizomata (underground
stems) interlaced with the very roots of the hedge-plants:
still, if pains be taken to pluck away the
bine as soon as it makes its appearance, it must in
time be destroyed; for, like even the hawthorn tree,
hardy as it is, if the leaves be kept from perfecting
themselves, they soon pine away, and ultimately die
altogether.</p>

<p>The other plants are more properly weeds of the
hedge-bank than of the hedge, and as such need only
be mentioned with weeds in general as pests to be
periodically removed by hoeing, digging, and otherwise
clearing the ground between and about the
hedge-row work, more particularly necessary in the
first few years of planting.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>

<h4>ON HEDGE-ROW TIMBER.</h4>

<p>Of the many sources of mischief to which the farmer
may be liable, we can conceive none greater than that
of being overgrown with hedge-row timber. It is
scarcely, if at all, second to that of being overstocked
with game&#8212;for as regards game, there is a chance of
getting some compensation for palpable injury; but
the mischief which trees silently but surely effect, when
surrounding fields, is never allowed for, as it is not
fully appreciated by the tenant, and never admitted by
the landlord; and so as hedge-row timber is usually
thicker in the richer parts of the country, it is somehow
considered as an evidence of fertility on the one
hand, while it is looked upon as a legitimate mode of
increasing income on the other.</p>

<p>But we are quite sure that hedge-row timber is
almost useless in itself, and a pest to all who must
live under it. Hedges themselves are usually too
many, and these too thick through them; and when
it comes to be understood that the enclosures are
smaller, the hedges often greater, and hedge-row timber
thicker on good than on bad lands, some idea
may be formed of the mischief which is inflicted by
thus hemming in fine land from light and air.</p>

<p>The following tables, by Mr. J. Bravender, land-surveyor,
of Cirencester, are the results of an &#8220;examination
of the fields contained in 120 parishes:&#8221;<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>The average quantity of the above saving is 1<sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> for every 100
acres.</p>

<p>If this saving were effected, which is quite practicable, it would
increase the cultivated land in England and Wales 490,000 acres,
and would be similar in its effect to the addition of a new county,
nearly equal in extent to Nottinghamshire, and somewhat larger than
Berkshire.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Morton&#8217;s Cyclop&aelig;dia of Agriculture</i>, p. 859.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above is the evidence of a highly practical
gentleman as regards the loss by bad, wide, and
straggling fences; and if we add to this the additional
loss and injury which the land sustains by the growth
of hedge-row timber, we shall find that we have even
a greater account to settle. Now, if we inquire into
the nature of these evils, we shall find that they result
from shade, drip, and exhaustion by roots.</p>

<p>There are those who speak in favour of hedge-row
timber as affording shade for cattle; but we should remember
that when this is so, the cattle, by being thus
gathered to one spot, only aid in manuring those portions
of the field where the grass is always more
rank than nutritious, and this to the robbery of other
portions of the field. For ourselves, we would rather
have our fields exposed to the influence of sun and
air, and, if required, have some contrivances for shade
which could be moved about the fields at pleasure.
The shade of trees keeps off those refreshing showers
so important to vegetation, but in much wet the
trees send down a drip which is sometimes found to
be so injurious as to prevent any good growth
beneath them, and then as the leaves fall off they
often poison the soil for some distance, while the
roots impoverish the land in every direction.</p>

<p>We have just visited a field, in the southern hedge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of which are growing some beech trees; these not
only keep off the southern sun, but their drip and
fallen leaves render fully one-eighth of the field nearly
useless.</p>

<p>Again, do we not everywhere find twice the number
of hedges that are required; and, to add to the mischief,
these filled with trees? In many places we see
elms not more than three yards apart. Here the shade
would be intolerable, but the farmer is allowed to lop
them until they look not unlike the stuck-up tails of
French poodle dogs&#8212;a process which certainly diminishes
the evils they entail upon the farmer, but
renders the timber comparatively useless.</p>

<p>But, say the advocates of tall hedges and hedge-row
timber, &#8220;How beautiful they make the country look!
Your plan would leave it all bare and desolate; no song
of birds to cheer the wayfarer,&#8221; &amp;c. But stop, good
people; we love trees, but we do not care so much for
straight lines of stuck-up <i>besoms</i>. Let the landlord
grow his woods and his groves, and plant his parks.
Let him put trees in parts which will grow nothing
better, and in belts to keep off malignant winds; and
even here (the best places for them), let him be content
with their pleasure and profit as a rent for the
ground they occupy, and not, as some do, insist upon
the tenant yearly planting trees in positions which must
injure so much land which he is still to pay rent for.
This is about as tyrannical as to make a schoolboy carry
a birch, and ask for its application.</p>

<p>As regards the loss of land by the division into
smaller fields, we cannot do better than copy the
former outlines of an arable field on our own farm.
This, which is now one field of over fifty acres, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
formerly in fifteen fenced fields, each with a ragged
hedge&#8212;of anything but quicks&#8212;planted upon raised
mounds. Now, the gain in the removal of fences,
indicated by the dotted lines (see <a href="#FigXXXI_1">fig. 1</a>), may be
explained by the following calculations:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>From these data, then, we may conclude that
if available land equal in extent to a county may
be gained by keeping fences within bounds, this may
be more than doubled by grubbing up, not merely
useless, but mischievous fences, and discountenancing
the growth of hedge-row timber.</p>

<p>Now, although we reside in the county of the
Dorsetshire poet, we are not of those who would
curtail the privileges of the poor by closing up all
footpaths, or by too rigidly curtailing the road space;
but as long as the farmer has to pay rent for the
ground needlessly occupied by badly-constructed
hedge-rows, we think it due to him, and even to the
poor themselves, that land now so occupied should
in future be made food-producing; and with these
sentiments we would conclude this chapter by

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE VERMIN OF FENCES.</h4>

<p>One of the great objections urged to more hedge-row
fences than are necessary, is that of harbouring
<i>Vermin</i>; it therefore becomes necessary to inquire
into the history of those creatures designated by a
name everywhere held in reproach.</p>

<p>The meaning of the term vermin has not been
very accurately defined. Johnson considers &#8220;any
noxious animal&#8221; to belong to vermin; whilst Bailey,
anxious to be more specific, defines vermin to be
&#8220;any kind of hurtful creature or insect, as rats,
mice, lice, fleas, bugs, &amp;c.;&#8221; but whatever lexicographers
may say upon the subject, there can be no
doubt that, in country language, what are known as
noxious animals are distinguished from noxious insects,
the first being in most counties known as
&#8220;Varment,&#8221; to which belong rats, mice, stoats, &amp;c.,
to which the keeper would add kites, hawks, owls,
magpies, and other birds; the second term being
limited to those parasitic creatures by which both
man and some inferior animals may be attacked.</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s notion of vermin, as applied to the
hedge-row, differs from these, as it includes all beasts,
birds, reptiles, insects, &amp;c., which directly injure
the hedge, together with such as choose the hedge-row
or the bank on which it might be grown as a
breeding-place, from which they migrate to farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
crops, and so become injurious, not to the hedge
alone, but to the farm in general.</p>

<p>Some notion of these may be inferred from the following
list:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1. The rabbit is one of the greatest pests to the
bank on which hedges are too often grown, and therefore
is injurious to the growing hedge, to say nothing
of the mischief which these creatures do to the crops.
The other day we visited a field in which a hedge-bank
had been undermined with no less than fifty
holes in the distance of five-and-twenty yards;
these ramified in every direction, not only through
the raised mound, but into the fields on either side
of the hedge, and out of which rabbits were dug
from a depth of as much as four feet. Here the
ridiculous nature of the mound was the primary
cause of the mischief, and hence we here offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
an illustration of the general facts which met our
view:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Here it will be seen that not only has nearly twenty
feet of land been taken up with the fence, but the
plan upon which it is made of itself suggests a rabbit-warren,
and especially when we say that the soil is of
a loose sandy nature, and the ditch has never yet been
a conduit for running water, and is therefore perfectly
unnecessary.</p>

<p>2. The hedge-hog is here only mentioned in the
hope of dispelling a popular prejudice with regard to
him. He is ruthlessly destroyed as vermin, on the
supposition that the hedge screens a traitor who is
ever ready to suck eggs or to take a meal from the
cow&#8217;s udder. Now, as regards the first charge, one
would have thought that, from the pertinacity
displayed by those who bring it in destroying
birds&#8217; eggs and birds of every kind, they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
little care upon this head. His sucking of cows has
never been witnessed by any competent observer, and
with such the idea was never entertained, nor can it
be supposed that a cow would suffer the approach of
a creature so thoroughly armed with spines as the
hedge-hog. In the words of Yarrell we may conclude
that &#8220;this is about as well-founded an accusation
as that of Pliny, exaggerated as it is by Sperling,
who assures us that it ascends trees, knocks off the
apples and pears, and, throwing itself down upon them
that they may stick to its spines, trots off with the
prize! &AElig;lian gives us the same story, substituting
figs for apples, and omitting the climbing power of
the animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. This section contains creatures for which few of
us entertain any affection; at the same time, it may
perhaps be true that some of the greatest of farm
pests, in the shapes of rats and mice, have greatly
increased since the destruction of the polecat, stoat,
and other of our smaller carnivorous quadrupeds.</p>

<p>As regards mice in general, one source of alarm
connected with their former occupancy of the hedge-row
has nearly vanished from among us. We allude
to the supposed injury they were thought to inflict on
any creature over which they might creep.</p>

<p>At one time, if a cow or sheep offered any symptom
of paralysis or injury, more particularly of the hind-quarters,
the creature was said to be &#8220;mouse-crope,&#8221;
for which were several popular remedies, which were
used by way of direct applications, such as a liberal
application of rods of wytch-hazel, drawing twigs of
mountain-ash or rowan-tree over the affected parts;
but the more general plan of action was to operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
upon the offending creature upon the same principle
as pertains to the present day in the case of a bite by
a dog&#8212;namely, that the bitten subject is not safe from
the direst calamities so long as the author of the
mischief is alive; and acting upon this, there are few
persons in rural districts who would not demand the
death of a dog by whom they may have been bitten,
and this not as a measure of precaution, to prevent
the like occurrence happening again, but as the first
thing to be done to ensure a safe cure. So with a
&#8220;mouse-crope&#8221; subject: action was at once taken
against the mouse, but this through the agency of
the &#8220;shrew-ash,&#8221; which potent remedy is thus
described by Gilbert White, in his charming &#8220;Natural
History of Selborne:&#8221;<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Now, a shrew-ash is an ash whose twigs or branches, when
gently applied to the limbs of cattle, will immediately relieve the
pains which a beast suffers from the running of a shrew-mouse over
the part affected; for it is supposed that a shrew-mouse is of so
baneful and deleterious a nature, that wherever it creeps over a
beast, be it horse, cow, or sheep, the suffering animal is afflicted with
cruel anguish, and threatened with the loss of the use of the limb.
Against this accident, to which they were continually liable, our
provident forefathers always kept a shrew-ash at hand, which, when
properly medicated, would maintain its virtue for ever. A shrew-ash
was made thus:&#8212;Into the body of the tree a deep hole was
bored with an augur, and a poor devoted shrew-mouse was thrust in
alive, and plugged in, no doubt, with several quaint incantations,
long since forgotten.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That the shrew-mouse was generally held in the
greatest dread, there is no doubt; but, we find in Dorsetshire,
where this notion still prevails, that the idea
of mischief is not confined to the shrew, but is believed
of any mouse. We had a steer in one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
feeding-pits, which, as he did not gain flesh, was said
to be &#8220;moss-crop,&#8221; the western vernacular for mouse-crope.
Still, field mice, without regard to species,
are supposed to be the most baneful in this way; at
the same time, we may trace an evidence of the former
generally prevailing belief in the injurious tendencies
of even our common mouse, in the fact that when you
have so far convinced a lady friend, who may have a
&#8220;horror of a mouse,&#8221; of their harmless nature, you
are sure to be met with the unanswerable remark,
which gains point from the manner of its utterance,
&#8220;But suppose a mouse should creep over me?&#8221; We
may now entirely discard every notion of the evils of
mouse-crope cattle as an argument against the hedge-row
as a harbour for rats and mice; still, these are
vermin in the true sense of the word, and which
hedge-rows, unless kept trim and clean at bottom,
are sure to encourage.</p>

<p>4. Snakes in hedge-rows are very common, and
especially on banks facing the south; of these, the
common ringed snake and the slow-worm are often
met with. They excite great terror in most people;
but still they may be said not merely to be quite
harmless, but absolutely useful, as they live upon
insects and small fry in general, and so, in reality,
they ought not to be classed as vermin, but take their
place amongst their most decided enemies.</p>

<p>5. The land mollusks, to which belong the snail
and the slug, are sheltered in hedges by thousands;
and highly destructive they are, and more especially
in small overshadowed enclosures. The quantity of
vegetation which these consume is enormous, and we
are sorry to think that they are on the increas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>e&#8212;a
fact which we deem to be due to the indiscriminate
slaughter of small birds, more especially the blackbird,
thrush, and lark, which are their most determined
enemies. As farmers, we might well afford
them a dessert of small fruit for the good they do in
destroying slugs and snails.</p>

<p>6. Hedge-row shrubs are liable to be injured by
many insects, more especially the caterpillars of different
kinds of moths and butterflies, which sometimes
eat away all their leaves, and so greatly retard
the growth of the hedge. Upon this subject we quote
from &#8220;Our Woodlands, Heaths, and Hedges,&#8221; for the
purpose of introducing to our readers a small book by
W. S. Coleman, which should be in the hands of all
country readers:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

chosen food of a great number of interesting insects, principally the
caterpillars of various <i>lepidoptera</i>.</p>

<p>Several species of these are of a gregarious nature, living together
in extensive colonies under a thick net-work of silk, which serves
them for a common protection while feeding on the foliage enclosed
with themselves in a silken tent.</p>

<p>Among these social net-weavers are the caterpillars of a fine insect,
the black-veined white butterfly (<i>Pieris crat&aelig;gi</i>), a rarity in some
districts, but in certain localities, and at certain periods, abounding
to such an extent as entirely to strip the hawthorn hedges of their
foliage. Similar depredations are committed by the gaily-coloured
progeny of the common lackey moth, and of the gold-tailed and
brown-tailed moths; but the most formidable devastators, though
the tiniest individually, are the little ermine moths (<i>Yponomenta</i>),
small silvery-grey creatures, minutely spotted with black. The
curious twig-like caterpillars of the brimstone moth (a pretty canary-coloured
creature, with brown markings), and of several other
geometers, are common upon hawthorn.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Last summer (1864), the hawthorn trees and hedges
about the parks and squares of London were entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
defoliated by caterpillars, which progressed from tree
to tree in squads of numberless individuals, only seeking
a new site of action when the former one had
been despoiled of every vestige of leaf and bud.</p>

<p>But it is not only the hawthorn which becomes
attacked by insects: all other hedge-row trees and
shrubs have their peculiar enemies, to describe which
would take more space than we have to spare, and we
therefore conclude the chapter with a few remarks
upon the weeds of dirty hedge-rows. These harbour
various insects, which migrate to our crops, and do an
immense amount of injury. For instance, such plants as
Jack by the Hedge (<i>Erysimum alliaria</i>), treacle mustard
(<i>Sisymbrium officinale</i>), wild mustards, and other
forms of <i>Crucifer&aelig;</i>, in hedge-rows, afford a winter
nidus for the turnip flea beetles (<i>Haltica concinna</i>
and <i>H. nemorum</i>),<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> from which they take their flight
to the more delicate turnip and swede crops as soon
as these come up.</p>

<p>Birds need only here be mentioned incidentally, as
there is still a conflict of opinions as to the use of the
bird family to the farmer; and those species which
mostly build in and frequent our hedges are perhaps
those upon which evil suspicions are most universally
held. Amongst these are the hedge-sparrow, finch,
linnet, and others&#8212;and that these are mischievous at
times, we are not prepared to deny; but we should
be sorry if the curtailment of hedges, for which we
are advocates, should result in the destruction of our
small birds, as we conclude most of the species to be
at times eminently useful.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE MANAGEMENT OF HEDGE-ROW FENCES.</h4>

<p>We shall, in the first place, treat the subject of management
in reference to fences composed of hawthorn.
In the newly-planted hedge we shall find that the
better the soil in which it is planted, the quicker and
stronger the young quicks will grow. If, then, the soil
be not good, or if it be thin, it will be worth while to
prepare it as well as circumstances will permit. This
may be done by deep digging, by bringing good soil
from a distance, or some aid may be given by means
of any kind of manure. It should ever be borne
in mind that to start with luxuriant growth is all-important,
as neglect in this matter at first can only
be partially remedied afterwards.</p>

<p>Good quicks, selected and removed with care,
carefully planted in well-prepared ground, not elevated
several feet on a dry sand-bank, or carelessly
grouted in a gutter of clay, will soon send out
vigorous shoots. These should be well weeded and
dug at least for three or four years, during which
time an occasional trimming of a wild shoot here
and there with the knife will rightly direct a more
even growth.</p>

<p>In weeding, the first advent of briars and brambles
should be looked to; so all seedling ash, elder, maple,
and defenceless trees in general, should be <i>taken out</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<i>by the roots</i>, not cut off, as this only makes a thicket
of a twig.</p>

<p>After three or four years, if the growth be sufficiently
strong, the young hedge may be trimmed to
a desired shape with the shears or the hook; but
if weak and straggling, we would strongly recommend
that the whole be boldly cut off within a few
inches of the base, the ground to be well dug and
even manured about the roots, and the protecting
railings to be put in order, and a new growth be
waited for, which, generally speaking, will not be
long&#8212;for by this means we believe that a good fence
will be sooner arrived at than by allowing weak wood
to go on growing still weaker.</p>

<p>Hawthorn fences are sometimes allowed to get
several feet high before being brought into reasonable
dimensions, in which case they get smooth,
unarmed, and unbranched stems at the base. This
state of things is too often attempted to be cured
by cutting out a quantity of the wood and laying
the rest, by partially dividing them near the ground&#8212;a
plan which is called &#8220;plashing.&#8221; This we think
highly objectionable: it would be far better to cut
off the whole to within a few inches of the ground,
and so trim the shoots as they grow again.</p>

<p>The truth is, that plashing gets out of order, the
layered sticks get out of place, and the whole is
aided by stakes of dead wood, which soon decay,
or, if not, are almost certain to be removed by the
constant country claimants to dead sticks in general.</p>

<p>We prefer that no dead materials should be put
to a living fence; for if there are gaps, it will be
best to dig the ground well and put in some young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
quicks, fencing with posts and rails, to guard the
plants as well as impound the cattle. Mending gaps
with thorns only aggravates the evil, as the living
part of the fence is so interfered with by the dead
matter that it grows but imperfectly, and the dead
materials soon rot away, leaving a greater gap to be
re-mended.</p>

<p>We have seen gaps tried to be repaired by old
quicks, but this seldom succeeds&#8212;for if they grow,
they are never bushy enough to be repellant; but they
often die altogether, and at best with old plants,
young quicks will repair the mischief in less time.</p>

<p>Seeing the difficulty there is sometimes in getting
quicks to grow well in hedge gaps, it is not uncommon
to fill up with various kinds of hedge-row plants,
such as hazel, whitebeam, spindle-tree, dogwood,
maple, &amp;c.; but the objection to these is, that they
are often not repellant in any way, and they help to
make weaker places broader than they found them,
and, indeed, ultimately get possession of the greater
part of the hedge-row. There is, then, nothing better
to mend a whitethorn hedge than quicks, and they will
grow if attended to for the first two or three years;
but why they usually fail is, that if planted in gaps
they are usually closely hemmed in by old thorns,
or allowed to become smothered by weeds.</p>

<p>With respect to very old hedges, made up of all
sorts of materials, we prefer cutting them down
about three feet from the ground, leaving all the
stubs to branch out, than to attempt to layer as
shrubs, and then the whitethorn succeeds even less
with plashing. Where, however, we have rough, but,
after all, not repellant fences, we should like to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
them re-planted, by which they could mostly be curtailed,
and at the same time opportunity may be taken
to get rid of some of them altogether, or to make
them in a more convenient direction.</p>

<p>We are now in possession of a hedge composed of
everything but hawthorn, and somewhere about
twelve feet high. It is without gaps, but still pregnable
at any point, by reason of the want of armature
in the shrubs of which it is composed. Still, as it
stands on the top of a bank five feet high, the mound
and hedge together is not so bad a fence as its materials
might warrant.</p>

<p>We here give a list of the plants of which this fence
is composed, in order to the more clear explanation
of what is to follow:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Now, here is a tall hedge on the north side of our
field, and so capable of affording no slight amount of
shelter to stock; but how much southern sun does it
keep off our neighbour&#8217;s field! And yet we have
just succeeded to a lease which contains a clause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
compelling this hedge to be annually trimmed&#8212;a process
which has not been performed for many years,
but which we shall hereafter show should be done,
especially where hedges have been properly cared for,
for the due keeping of the fence itself; but further, we
feel convinced that a proprietor should be able to call
upon the owner of a neighbouring estate to keep his
portion of the fences within such bounds as may not
be injurious.</p>

<p>In the case before us, what is best to be done? Custom
says, &#8220;Lay it; plash it.&#8221; Still, the materials
are not suitable for this process. &#8220;Cut it down and
it will shoot up again,&#8221; says the hedger, who would
be ready to do the work for the wood; but mark,
that in order to get as much as possible, it would be
cut close to the ground. Our plan will be to cut it
at about a yard from the top of the mound, and
afterwards to watch the young shoots, so as carefully
to trim them, in order to induce them to throw out
laterals, and thus make, at least, a thick growth,
though of unpromising materials.</p>

<p>With regard to trimming by the piece: if it be
really a well-grown quick-set hedge, the keeping it to
a certain standard may be easily accomplished; but
if it be a weakly growth of all kinds of shrubs, the
labourer slashes as close to the ground as he can
with the hook, in order to &#8220;have something to cut
against&#8221;&#8212;a process which only makes the hedges
weaker the oftener it is performed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h3>

<h4>COVENANTS WITH REGARD TO FENCES, ETC.</h4>

<p>From what has been already advanced, it will be seen
that the matter of fences is most important in connection
with the arrangements between landlord and
tenant.</p>

<p>The landlord for the most part gets the same rent
for the land occupied by fences as for the whole of
the field, such land being calculated with the acreage;
and, further, with the tenant-at-will he insists upon
their being kept in order&#8212;that is, if he cares for or
knows anything about order&#8212;at the expense of the
tenant. In leases there are usually inserted covenants
obliging annual trimming of fences and scouring
of ditches; but, generally speaking, the tenant does
just as much as he likes, and the landlord knows but
little about it. At the same time, annual trimming
of hedges would often be mischievous; and again, as
some hedges would be well to be let grow tall, on
account of the shelter they might afford, there will be
so many circumstances to be considered in coming to
a right conclusion about what should be done to
fences, that it is no wonder that covenants are only
insisted upon in a very partial manner, and the careless
farmer, instead of repairing hedges in a permanent
manner, is content to mend gaps&#8212;or &#8220;shards,&#8221;
as they are called in the midland counties&#8212;only when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
he wants to keep his beasts in any particular meadow
or field.</p>

<p>We shall shortly discuss these views under the
following heads:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Fences should not be kept up to a greater extent
than is required.<br />

2. A tenant-at-will should not be expected to plant
or take charge of fences.<br />

3. Evils of bad fences.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>1. The curtailment and removal of fences is, as
already shown, a matter of great moment, not only as
providing more available land for cultivation, but as
exposing a greater surface even of the cultivated
portions of fields to the influence of light and air. But
on any estate where this has been deemed advisable,
we have usually seen that as the work has been, as it
were, divided amongst the tenants, it has either been
done without judgment, or, if performed well, yet
by men of different views, as having different requirements,
so that it has resulted in a patchy and anything
rather than an uniform improvement.</p>

<p>We would advise that the landlord or his agent
take charge of this matter, with a view to that uniform
improvement which would affect the whole
estate. In this case it would be to the interest of
the proprietor to make the run of the fences as
straight as possible, to plant quicks, to mend gaps,
and properly to fence them with rails. Were this
the case, we should hardly see gaps filled up with
dead materials, only to widen them as time advances
by killing more of the living wood, or, what is even
worse, left as roadways to tempt the trespasser. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
fine, as the estate would be improved by having
perfect fences, and therefore would fetch a better
rent, it would appear to be the landlord&#8217;s duty to
see it attended to, and not to expect to charge a
tenant for bad fences, and to insist upon his constantly
mending them into the bargain, or it will
naturally follow that they will seldom be up to a
high standard of perfection.</p>

<p>2. A tenant-at-will, or even a leaseholder, should
not be expected to plant new fences, or to cultivate
those already planted, when it involves expenses
from which he cannot reap the benefit. In the first
place, it is not only the planting, but weeding and
pruning&#8212;not merely slashing&#8212;that is required,
all involving time, expense, and judgment, which
no man would be justified in expending upon a precarious
holding.</p>

<p>But take the case of a leaseholder for seven years.
In our own parish, on the light oolite sands, is a
quick-set hedge, which has been badly planted&#8212;now
entering upon the fourth year since&#8212;upon the top
of a thin mound of sandy soil, from four to five feet
high. The quicks are not so good as when they
were planted; it can <i>never</i> make a good hedge.
Briars and brambles, and various shrubs common to
oolite soils, will smother out the quicks, and altogether
it will result in failure. Here the landlord
should not expect his tenant to weed, and it is not
worth his while to even find &#8220;rough timber&#8221; for
forming a defence of such a hedge from the cattle,
nor will it pay the tenant to employ a carpenter to
work it. In this case the landlord should level the
soil and re-plant the hedge&#8212;not on a mound of sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
but in the well-dug surface soil&#8212;efficiently fence it,
and see to its annual weeding. In this way, instead
of his having to find rough timber for fences for
all time, one set of rails should be enough, and so
he would ultimately save money for time by a present
judicious expenditure; and, besides, as he would
give his tenant more available land for his acreage,
and this better secured, so that trespassers are kept
from without and his cattle prevented straying from
within, the holding would certainly be more valuable.</p>

<p>3. With bad fences the land is not at command.
There has to be superintendence and mending whenever
a field is wanted to be used. We recollect a
farmer who, having bought some pigs, on being asked
by his man where he was to put &#8217;em, replied, &#8220;Oh,
put &#8217;em in the garden, for if you don&#8217;t they&#8217;ll very
soon get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a case of bad fences about the homestead,
and we may be sure everywhere else too. And here
we would controvert the assertion that is too often
made, that &#8220;the farmer who is a careful gardener
will be a bad farmer.&#8221; We have ever seen that attention
to neatness and order, at home and in the fields,
will mark the good farmer, though it may not always
assure us of the prosperous one. The truth is, that
neatness is sometimes expensive; and as it does not
always yield any greater reward than gratification to
the tenant, it should at all times be encouraged by
the landlord with every possible assistance, as he can
never be a loser thereby, but must be the gainer.</p>

<p>The truth is, that there is nothing about estates or
farms which so much requires remodelling as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
system of fences. They want lessening, as the land
is cut up into far too many awkward little pieces.
They want straightening and paralleling, if we may
so express it. They should, too, be kept within due
compass, both as to breadth and height, so that
altogether, as to material, mode of planting, position,
and general supervision, the hedge-row really is in
want of that kind of treatment which only a far-seeing,
comprehensive overseer can direct, and which,
were we to come into the possession of a large estate,
would be the first process for its amelioration and
improvement that we should attend to.</p>

<p>In fact, it may be said that this subject is daily
receiving a greater share of attention, and that for a
reason at first little suspected; but the truth is,
steam is asserting its power on the farm as on the
road, and as the engine marches into our fields, fences
will be levelled before his mightiness&#8212;all sorts of
crooked corners and queer-shaped angles will be
removed, and the whole will assume a more regular
outline.</p>

<p>There are moral evils connected with bad fences
which we think have hardly been duly considered.
We have hinted at their encouragement of trespassers
and fostering of idle habits.</p>

<p>In our own parish are gaps leading from one field
and from one farm to another. This encourages idle
vagabonds to go anywhere&#8212;everywhere&#8212;on pretence
of shooting small birds, many of which are often of
more value than themselves; and if there is no gap
already, how easy to push through twigs of cornel,
ash, guelder rose, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Such hedges, again, are mended with dead thorns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and stakes and rails of wood, which soon decay and
become a prey to all the old women and idle children
in the parish, the latter of whom hasten the
period when they may claim them by climbing
through and over them, and so prematurely despoil
what they soon take home as of right.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, we hazard the assertion that
well-grown and well-kept fences are a boon to all.
They benefit the landlord, by enabling him to give
well-secured acres in exchange for his rent. Like good
&#8220;buildings,&#8221; fences benefit the farmer by affording
him protection for his property. They benefit the
poor, by removing a great source of lawless habits, and
that commencement of petty larceny which too often
leads to a complete negation of conscience.</p>

<p>They benefit all, inasmuch as Order, which &#8220;is
Heaven&#8217;s first law,&#8221; is Man&#8217;s best friend.</p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD TIMBER.</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<h4>ON THE VALUE OF TIMBER FOR ORNAMENT
AND PROFIT.</h4>

<p>Among all the varied productions (says Strutt<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>) with
which nature has adorned the surface of the earth,
none awakens our sympathies, or interests our imagination,
so powerfully as those venerable trees
which seem to have stood the lapse of ages&#8212;silent
witnesses of the successive generations of man, to
whose destiny they bear so touching a resemblance,
alike in their budding, their pride, and their decay.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Introduction to &#8220;Sylva Britannica.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Hence, in all ages, the earliest dawn of civilization
has been marked by a reverence of woods and
groves; devotion has fled to their recesses for the
performance of her most solemn rites; princes have
chosen the embowering shade of some wide-spreading
tree, under which to receive the deputations of
the neighbouring &#8220;great ones of the earth;&#8221; and
angels themselves, it is recorded, have not disdained
to deliver their celestial messages beneath the same
verdant canopy. To sit under the shadow of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
own fig-tree, and drink of the fruit of his own vine,
is the reward promised, in Holy Writ, to the
righteous man; and the gratification arising from the
site of a favoured and long-remembered tree is one
enjoyed in common by the peer, whom it reminds,
as its branches wave over his head whilst wandering
in his hereditary domains, of the illustrious
ancestors who may have seen it planted; and by
the peasant, who recalls, as he looks on it in his way
to his daily labours, the sports of his infancy round
its venerable trunk, and regards it at once as his
chronicler and landmark.</p>

<p>Who indeed amongst us, in whatever position of
life he may be, or in what land soever his lot may
be cast, does not often find his mind&#8217;s eye resting
upon some favourite tree; it may be some huge elm
on his village green, where, in the dim twilight, he
either told or listened to the fairy tale or exciting
ghost story; or the spreading oak, beneath whose
shade he has picnicked; or the haunted grove,
where his tale, though only whispered, yet spoke
loudly to a willing listener.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>But we must not be led astray by the poetical
emotions which are sure to rise up within us at the
contemplation of forest trees; we shall therefore
confine ourself, in this treatise, more particularly to
a general description of the genera and species of
trees usually grown in Great Britain for timber, with
an explanation of some of the principles connected
with the growth of timber.</p>

<p>Timber in a country where trees are almost, if not
wholly, planted, affords a subject for consideration
very different from that of wild aboriginal forests;
in the former we have to consider our subjects as
objects for cultivation, and that with a view of yielding
profit or pleasure, or both, whilst the study of
trees in the forest would naturally resolve itself into
a botanical and physiological inquiry into specific
forms. While, therefore, we would not here neglect
the latter, our arrangement of trees and their history
will have more particular reference to their cultivation,
a subject which will probably address itself
more especially to the landlord than to the tenant
farmer.</p>

<p>In the main, then, the primary object of growing
trees is that of profit, whilst a secondary&#8212;or with
some even primary&#8212;consideration will be that of
ornamentation; and we admit that, apart from any
other consideration, a landed estate without timber
would be as bare, cold, and comfortless as a house
without furniture; at the same time, too many trees,
and these in themselves awkwardly grown and stuck
about in all sorts of awkward positions, would be like
an over-furnished and ill-regulated mansion.</p>

<p>We would, then, have that kind of thought exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in planting which should result, if not in
profit, at least in providing ornament without loss,
either to the tenant on the one hand, or the proprietor
on the other. To this end we would advocate
setting apart portions of the estate for the cultivation
of timber in belt plantations, or even in woods,
having reference to the nature of the soil and general
position, and this in preference to hedge-row planting,
as long lines of ash or elm can never look
ornamental however well-grown; but, inasmuch as
this mode of growth necessitates lopping, the timber
is so long in growing and then is never good, that it
seldom pays even the expenses attendant upon its
utilization.</p>

<p>In plantations, again, you can adopt such a system
of growing nurses that some return for the outlay
will not be many years in commencing, and so
profit by way of rent is not delayed as in hedge-row
growth.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> We are aware that the landlord too often considers hedge-row
timber as costless; but the injury which it entails upon the farm, and
its nearly useless character, leads us to view the matter in a different
light.</p></div>

<p>In order to understand what we would call a forest
nurse, let us suppose that in a certain position our
object is to grow a plantation of oak: we might in
this case mix beech, elm, larch, Scotch firs, and
spruce with the oak; these, by growing together,
would increase an upward development; they would
&#8220;pull each other up,&#8221; as usually expressed. Soon
this lateral growth would cause them to approach
each other too closely, and then the larch would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
be first cut out, perhaps for hop-poles; next the
spruce and Scotch firs for fencing and other purposes;
then the beech and elm as they became useful; and
at last, all the nurses gone, the oak would be sufficient
to occupy the space, and, though many years
have passed in the process, the wood has all the time
yielded something towards rent and expenses.</p>

<p>In planting, of course, the kinds to be planted
will depend upon circumstances, and so to a great
extent will the methods to be adopted in planting;
it may, however, be here stated that three plans
of preparing the soil have been recommended:&#8212;1.
<i>Trenching</i>; 2. <i>Pitting</i>; and 3. <i>Ploughing</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Trenching</i> is a very expensive process, and, upon
the whole, is scarcely worth the cost. It is true that
digging and turning over the soil will cause a number
of weeds to die, but, on the other hand, it encourages
the growth of greater numbers than it destroys, and
it is doubtful whether weeding can be done so well
in the loosened ground as it could before. Supposing,
then, the young trees to be planted in old turf, we
consider trenching to be quite unnecessary; but, as
the plants will flourish best when weeds and grass
are kept under, we should advise the skinning of the
turf round them annually for about three years with
a common mattock, and at the same time advantage
to be taken of the opportunity to tread in the trees
more firmly when they may have become loosened;
to remove any broken or decayed matter, as in the
case of conifers, to see to the training of a single
leader, rather than two or more; and in all cases
where young conifers show an increasing disposition
to grow a great quantity of fruits (cones), we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
either dig around it, and, perhaps, apply a portion of
manure, or sacrifice the plant and put a fresh one in
its stead.</p>

<p>This premature fruiting arises sometimes from the
roots of the plant having been too much crippled,
either by breaking or drying from being kept too long
out of the ground; we may here state, then, that, if
only to prevent this, in all cases of transplantation,
they should be taken out of the nursery with great
care, so as to injure the roots as little as possible, and
further be planted in their new home with the utmost
despatch. Disappointment is sure to result where
trees of any kind have been kept long out of the
ground, as they are when bought at market or in
packets at sales. We should never purchase at the
latter, unless they were left in the ground to be
fetched as might be required.</p>

<p>As we have been led incidentally to remark upon
the subject of crippling by means of injured roots,
we may now point out that the same thing occurs
where young trees have been topped either for mischief,
or injudiciously pruned. We remember having
some larches thus damaged by some vagabond boy,
and in seven years they were only dwarf cone-bearing
bushes, whilst others planted at the same time were
15 feet in height. In this case, then, instant
removal, when discovered, and the being replaced
by fresh plants, would after all be a saving of time
in getting useful sticks.</p>

<p>2. <i>Pitting.</i>&#8212;In this process the soil is sometimes
dug out so as to make holes about 2 feet square, the
soil being left to weather by the sides of the holes,
and returned around the trees when they are planted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
This is not nearly so expensive as trenching; but it,
too, is not always advisable, for trees have the tendency
to confine their roots to the dug-out space
for some years, and so they do not get the hold upon
the ground that they otherwise would.</p>

<p>This plan is that of partial trenching, and we
should prefer the former to the pitting process, unless
where stones, such as those found in the oolite rocks,
come to the surface. In such case, the removal
of some of the larger stones and supplementing
them with soil from some other source we have found
to be of advantage.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ploughing</i> the soil is as expeditious a plan of
preparing and clearing it as we possess; and now
that steam cultivation can be brought into action for
a much greater depth than could be done with horses,
smashing-up the land by its means would be no bad
preparation for planting where this is to be done on
tolerably level ground.</p>

<p>While upon this subject we may here quote, as
still worthy of attention, the directions in the fourth
edition of the &#8220;Sylva.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Let us now see in what manner we are to prepare the ground
for their reception. The best way is by trenching, or double digging,
as deep as the soil will admit of; but as this is a very expensive proceeding,
and consequently can only be practised upon a small scale, I
shall recommend another good method of preparing the ground. This
is to be done by proper ploughing, and, if agreeable, the year before
the land is planted, it may bear a crop of oats, rape, or turnips. By
this means the sward will be effectually destroyed. After the crop is
off, let the ground be trench-ploughed, and then harrowed with very
heavy harrows, to break the clods; about the end of October let it
be again ploughed crossways, and harrowed as before. This is the
season for planting the sets, for the ground, by being thus cross-ploughed<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and well harrowed, will be in proper order for their
reception. The manner of planting the sets is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>First, carefully take the plants out of the seed-beds, shorten the
tap-root, and take off part of the side-shoots, that there may be an
equal proportion of strength between the stem and the root. If the
wood is designed to be but small, ten, twenty, or thirty acres, then
lines may be drawn, and the trees planted in rows, four feet distant
from each other, and the trees two feet asunder in the row: each line
must have a man and a boy for planting. The ground being made
light and pliable by cross-ploughing and harrowing, the man strikes his
spade into the earth close to the line; he then takes it out, and gives
another stroke at right angles with it; then the boy, having a parcel
of plants under his left arm, takes one with his right hand, and
readily puts it into the crevice made by the spade at the second
stroke; after this the man gently presses the mould to it with his
foot, and thus the young oakling is planted. He proceeds in the
same manner to the next, and so on till all is finished. An active
man with his boy will plant 1,500 or 2,000 in a day; and while they
are planting others should be employed in taking up fresh sets from
the seed-bed, sorting them, and preparing their roots. In short, a
sufficient number of hands should be set to every part of this work,
that the whole may be carried on with despatch and regularity; for
the ground cannot be too soon furnished with its plants after it is in
readiness to receive them, neither can the plants be put too early into
the ground after they are taken up from the seminary. Those
plants which are nearly of the same size should be made to occupy a
large quarter together, and the weakest should be left in the seminary
a year longer to gain strength.</p>

<p>The trees, either for small or large plantations, being in the
ground, the first care should be to fence them well from cattle, and
even, if possible, from rabbits and hares. The next should be to keep
them clear from weeds, that they may not be incommoded in their
growth. In all lands weeds must be carefully watched and destroyed
at their first appearance. In small plantations hoeing may do; but
where the plantations are large and noble, a double-shelving plough
should be provided; and when the weeds are got two or three inches
high, this must be drawn exactly down the middle of each row by
horses with their mouths muzzled, somebody leading the foremost
horse; this plough will effectually throw a ridge each way, so that<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the edge of it will be almost contiguous to the plants on both sides.
This being done, the whole surface of the ground will be changed,
and the weeds all buried, except a few about the stems of the plants,
which a man following the plough should cut or pluck up. In this
manner the ground may lie until a fresh crop of weeds present
themselves; when these are about three inches high, a common
plough should be provided to go up one side of the row and down
the other, to plough the ridges made by the double-shelving plough
into their former places, men following with hoes to destroy such
weeds as are near the stems of the trees. Thus will the whole scene
be changed again; the ground will appear as new-tilled; and in this
condition it may remain until the weeds call for the double-shelving
plough a second time, which must also be followed alternately with
the common plough as occasion may require. By this means the
ground will not only be kept clear of weeds, but the earth, by
constant stirring, will be more replete with nourishing juices, the
gentle showers will produce their good effects, the sun will have his
influence, and all the powers of vegetation will combine to nourish
and set forward the infant oak. This work must be repeated every
year, until the oaks are of a height sufficient to destroy the weeds,
which may be, perhaps, in three or four years, according to the
goodness of the ground in which they are planted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still, notwithstanding the care sometimes taken
in planting, we have often observed that the
simple method of making triangular or cruciform
openings with the spade, thus&#8212;<span class="lettsymb">Y +</span>, and carefully
dividing the roots in putting the plants in their places,
and afterwards well pressing the turf against them,
has succeeded as well as any other method. Indeed,
we have known plants put in with only a single slit;
but this never succeeds so well, though it is more expeditiously
performed. Where, however, trees are put
in at so much an acre, the plan of action must be
specified, and the proceedings carefully watched, to
ensure its due performance, or the work will most
likely be done in the quickest, and not best, manner.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>

<h4>ON THE KINDS OF TIMBER BEST ADAPTED
FOR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.</h4>

<p>That the growth and quality of timber will be
influenced by the nature of the soil is a matter so
well understood that it would scarcely require to be
treated of in this place, if we did not daily see examples
of planting in which all laws of growth have
been set at defiance; still, occasionally, experience
has lent her aid and produced some satisfactory results;
and, as an exemplification of our meaning, and
as showing the influence of geological position upon
planting, we would direct attention to the following
section:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="figc600">
<p class="caption">ALICE HOLT FOREST.</p>
<img src="images/illo302.png" alt="Section through forest" width="600" height="156" />

</div>

<p>Here we have the oak&#8212;of both varieties known to
planters, to be hereafter described&#8212;flourishing most
luxuriantly on the stiff soil of the gault; the chalk-marl,
upper green sand, and gault&#8212;the two latter
only partially&#8212;being engaged in hop cultivation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
The green sand surrounding the forest is mostly devoted
to the growth of larch or spruce, the thinnings
of which are used for hop-poles and the
larger trees are left as timber-belts; whilst the beech
will be found to favour the chalk. Hops and other
cultivated plants flourish according to geological
position.</p>

<p>That the geology of a district affects vegetation
mainly, according to the mechanical and chemical
structure of its individual rocks and the climate in
which they are situate, is quite true; and yet the
following table will show that different formations
favour the growth of trees upon other conditions than
those named.</p>

<p>Choosing figures to represent relative values, the
annexed table is intended to show the amount of
influence exercised by certain geological rocks in the
growth of different fruit and forest trees met with in
England.</p>

<p>These figures may serve to express&#8212;although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
roughly&#8212;the capacities of different formations for
the production of fruit and forest trees, and it may
be curious to note that, while the chalk and the
oolite freestones, both composed of carbonate of lime,
offer a remarkable agreement in point of dendrological
productions, the mountain limestone, also consisting
of carbonate of lime, affords very different
results; here, no doubt, the different kinds of scenery
presented by the rocks themselves have a decided
influence on the general results.</p>

<p>Much, however, of any geological influence in the
growth of trees must depend upon the material
rather than upon the position of the rocks forming
the subsoil upon which they occur, and thus it may
be expected that clays, limestones, and sands, and
different mixtures of these, will each favour the
growth of a peculiar spontaneous or native vegetation;
so that, if we looked to a larger list of trees
and coupled it with lists of herbaceous plants, we
might make out even a stronger case, either for the
effects of geological or lithological conditions; but
enough has been said to point out that various trees
naturally affect one position more than another, and
so they succeed as the results of planting and cultivation
in one kind of soil in preference to another, and
it may be laid down as a rule, that pomaceous fruits
and hard-wooded trees, as oak and elm, only <i>flourish</i>
in strong soils, though they may be imperfectly
grown in all soils, whilst soft-wooded trees, as beech,
lime, and the conifer&aelig;, succeed best in lighter soils;
hence, then, the planter who would try to grow
vigorous oak on sandbeds would be disappointed,
and while beech is the &#8220;weed&#8221; of the Cotteswold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
oolite, whoever tries to grow an orchard upon the
freestone rocks is sure to meet with disappointment.</p>

<p>As regards forest trees we shall, for the most part,
confine our remarks to those of the following list,
as, although of recent years many new genera and
species have been introduced, they are not yet in
general cultivation even for ornamental purposes,
much less as a source of profit.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE BRITISH OAK.</h4>

<p>Whilst the discussion is still pending, of iron
against wooden bulwarks, if only for the love we feel
towards the &#8220;brave old oak,&#8221; a few notes upon the
forms of this truly national tree can hardly fail to be
acceptable. At starting, however, we must bear in
mind, that though we have ever looked upon the oak
as so thoroughly British that we had almost been
brought to think that it was made for the sole glory
of our land, yet there are those who would wish to
cast a doubt upon its true aboriginal nature, and who,
according to their custom, represent everything great
as borrowed from the Continent. What says, however,
that pleasant discourser on forest trees, Jacob George
Strutt, of imperishable sylvan fame:&#8212;&#8220;In proportion
as the oak is valued above all other trees, so is the
English oak esteemed above that of any other country,
for its particular characteristics of hardness and
toughness, qualities which so peculiarly fit it to be
the &#8216;father of ships,&#8217; and which are so admirably
expressed in two epithets by that great poet, to whom
the book of nature and of the human heart seemed
alike laid open:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou rather with thy sharp and sulph&#8217;rous bolt<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than the soft myrtle.&#8221;&#8212;<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Selby again, in his &#8220;History of Forest Trees,&#8221; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
work which should be in the hands of all lovers of the
beautiful natural objects of which it treats, describes
the finding of some bog oaks, which would almost
connect the present race with a fossilized past:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>At the Linden, the seat of C. W. Bigge, Esq., the trunk of a magnificent
oak was extracted from a peat moss that fills a small basin
or hollow, evidently produced by the stagnation of a stream, which
now passes through it, and which, at some distant period, had been
dammed back by the fall of the trees upon its margins. This oak was
covered by a layer of the peat to the depth of about three feet, and
was discovered by probing the moss. The trunk, with a small portion
of one of the larger limbs, was with great labour and difficulty
dragged from its miry bed. The contents of the portion recovered
contained 545 cubic feet, although the whole of the sap-wood had
perished. The timber was perfectly sound, and the tree, by whatever
accident it had been overthrown, had fallen in the vigour of its
growth. When sawn up, the interior planks were found of a deep
rich brown colour; those nearer the exterior darker, or approaching
to black. A variety of elegant furniture has been made from the
wood; but it has been found necessary, for fine cabinet-work, to have
it cut into veneers, for, when worked in bulk, it is apt to crack and
become warped. Remains of other huge oaks have also been met
with on the banks of the Tyne, the Alne, and other rivers, as well as
in various bogs and morasses; and we mention these instances to
show that in a district where, at the present day, nothing but
recently-planted oak or dwarfish timber from stock-shoots exists, in
former times the monarch of the forest grew luxuriantly, and attained
a splendid development; and also as an inducement to the planter
not to neglect the liberal insertion of this national tree wherever
soil and situation are found congenial to its growth. In other parts
of England, the oak still grows in all its native magnificence of form
and dimensions, and the remains of those ancient forests, which are
chronicled by our earliest writers, and which, in the time of our
Saxon ancestors, spread over the greater portion of the country, are
still to be traced in the venerable but living relics of enormous oaks,
many of which are supposed to number more than a thousand years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not to neglect to plant the national tree! We hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
indeed that there is no possessor of broad acres who
does not esteem it a duty, regardless of profit, to provide
for a succession of forest kings, if only to beautify the
face of the country, and to leave the people of the
present, some grand living object to connect them with
the history of the past. In fact, planting of the
&#8220;British oak&#8221; has not only been considered a duty, but
followed out with the keenest pleasure by the country
gentleman. In so doing, the question has scarcely
until lately occurred, is the British oak always the
same? or, are there not different species, or at least
varieties of the genus <i>quercus</i> which have been confounded
by the planter? To this question we now
propose to address our inquiries.</p>

<p>On referring to different authors, we shall find
mention of the following names as applied to the
British oak:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Quercus robur, <i>Linn</i>.<br />

2. <span class="padl3 padr3">&#8222;</span> sessiliflora, <i>Salisbury</i>.<br />

3. <span class="padl3 padr3">&#8222;</span> intermedia, <i>Don</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This method of nomenclature would, however, be only
tenable on the supposition that we considered the
trees so named <i>specifically</i> distinct; but as we incline
to believe them to be only varieties&#8212;though highly
important as such&#8212;we intend to treat of them as
follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

in trees separate from others by its robust
habits, thick, gnarled, twisted, and more or less horizontally
inclined branches. The leaves have comparatively
few broad, wavy indentations, and are set
on a short leaf-stalk (petiole) (<a href="#PedunculataFig">Plate I. fig. <i>a</i></a>), the
fruit being situate on long footstalks (peduncles),
varying from two to upwards of four inches (<a href="#PedunculataFig">fig. <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<p>This is the tree that seems to be longer lived than any
other in Britain, and though it would appear to be
the prey of nearly, if not quite, two hundred species
of insects, it has still had vigour of constitution to
survive them all; and in many instances we might
point to brave old trees which must have been
veterans at the time of the Norman Conquest. Now,
however, they are old and staggy, with hollow trunks

<p>This, indeed, is a melancholy sight, like the Stag&#8217;s
Horn Oak by the roadside between Farnham and
Woolmer, in the ancient boundary of Alice Holt
Forest; yet this has a young tree growing by its side,
perhaps one of his own children, which gracefully
conceals much of his gaunt nakedness. In the same
forest are many old staggy trees, their contorted
horn-like branches sticking out in a most picturesque
manner from the top and sides of a still leafy head.
In these the white owls may yet be seen peering out
of dark cavernous hollows as they did in Gilbert
White&#8217;s day; and during the summer of 1861 we
with pleasure watched their motions, which so minutely
agreed with those described by the father of
observing naturalists, that we cannot forbear quoting
his remarks thereon in his &#8220;Natural History of
Selborne,&#8221; a not very distant parish from the Holt,
and to which he indeed often refers:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>As I have paid particular attention to the manner of life of these
birds (the White Owl), during their season of breeding, which lasts
the summer through, the following remarks may not be unacceptable.
About an hour before sunset (for then the mice begin to run), they<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
sally forth in quest of prey, and hunt all round the hedges of meadows
and small enclosures for them, which seem to be their only food. In
this irregular country we can stand on an eminence and see them
beat the fields over like a setting-dog, and often drop down in the
grass or corn. I have minuted these birds with my watch for an
hour together, and have found that they return to their nest, the one
or the other of them, about once in five minutes; reflecting at the
same time on the adroitness that every animal is possessed of as far
as regards the well-being of itself and offspring.</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the good done by these birds in
keeping under mice, all our eloquence could scarcely
preserve them from the onslaught of the keeper; they
were, however, protected during our pleasant sojourn
at the Holt; but we much fear only, after all, to
gratify the taste for stuffed birds, a <i>love</i> which is
equally fatal to the feathered race (and especially the
finest examples thereof) as the <i>hate</i> of the keeper.</p>

<p>But we are digressing sadly, and must return to
<i>Quercus Robur pedunculata</i>, and complete our observations
thereon with the statement that most, if not
all, the nobler examples of oaks in England belong to
this form. Selby directs attention to the &#8220;Flitton
Oak, in Devonshire, of the <i>Sessiliflora</i> variety, supposed
to be one thousand years old, and which is
thirty-three feet in circumference at one foot from
the ground.&#8221; However, nearly every historical oak
is of the pedunculate variety. In the Holt forest are
still left some huge examples; the same in the Dean
forest; and Braydon, near Swindon, Wilts, though
disafforested, can yet show noble trees of this form.
Indeed, throughout England it is difficult to meet
with many examples of any other form, except in
Wyre forest, Worcestershire, where the tree next to
be described is perhaps the more general, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
would also appear that in the New Forest the
<i>Q. sessiliflora</i> is also frequently met with.</p>

<p><i>Quercus Robur sessiliflora</i> may be generally described
as of a more upright and formal habit. Limbs
straighter and less gnarled. Bark usually smoother
than the former. The leaf has many sinuosities, and
is set on a comparatively long leaf-stalk (petiole)
(<a href="#SessilifloraFig">Plate II. fig. <i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p>The fruit, on the contrary, is so nearly sessile that
it may be said to have little more than the indication
of a peduncle (<a href="#SessilifloraFig">fig. <i>b</i></a>).</p>

<p>We have already stated our opinion that the sessile-fruited
oak does not usually attain the huge dimensions
of the pedunculate form; but on the other hand
we incline to the belief that it grows more rapidly,
and is best adapted for a lighter soil than the latter.
There are conditions which might to a greater or less
extent affect the quality of its timber, but we do not
think that there is much difference in this respect.
We believe that their wood has been used indifferently,
and the quality is influenced by surrounding circumstances.
Selby, in his &#8220;History of Forest Trees,&#8221;
states on this head:&#8212;&#8220;The result, perhaps, of some
original constitutional defect, or arising from the
nature of the soil, situation, or other local peculiarities
of the ground upon which the timber has been
raised; such at least is the result of our own experience,
as we have met with oak of the <i>peduncled</i>
kind, its timber possessing all the inferior qualities
attributed to, and supposed to be possessed exclusively
by, <i>Q. sessiliflora</i>.&#8221; The longer, straighter
spars of the Sessiliflora, in days when oak was so uniformly
used for roofs, seem to have pointed out this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
variety for roof-timbering; and hence some of the
finest ancient timbered roofs of this country have
been ascertained to have been formed from its wood.
With respect to these the opinion long prevailed that
they were formed of the wood of the Spanish chestnut.
This, however, is but a poor timber tree, as, long
before it could afford so large a scantling as would
be required by the roof of the Parliament House at
Edinburgh or of Westminster Abbey (both of which
were supposed to be of chestnut), the chestnut would
begin to decay at the heart; in fact, just at the period
when the heart-wood of oak begins to harden, that of
the chestnut would appear to deteriorate.</p>

<p><i>Quercus Robur intermedia</i>, having a petiole intermediate
in length between the other two varieties
described, and a peduncle varying from a quarter to
one inch in length, may with propriety be deemed
a variety intermediate between &#8220;Sessiliflora&#8221; and
&#8220;Pedunculata,&#8221; and a comparison of the three will
substantiate its claim to this title.</p>

<p>As a tree it is impossible to make out any specific
character from its mode of growth, and, indeed,
without the fruit, it is extremely difficult even to
distinguish it as a variety.</p>

<p>It occurs&#8212;only occasionally&#8212;in the Cotteswold
district, and we suppose the same elsewhere. One
meets with it here and there in the hedge-rows, and
in Oakley Park, the seat of Earl Bathurst, we can
point out a few specimens.</p>

<p class="caption">Galls of the <i>Cynips Quercus petiolata</i>.<br />
(Natural size.)</p>
</div>

<p>Passing from the subject of the varieties of our
British oak, it now remains to mention a most formidable
enemy by which it has of late years been
attacked, and so exclusively, that in plantations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
where may be found the American oaks, the Ilex
oak, and Turkey oak trees, it has been the only one
subjected to the operations of the new gall pest. It
has long been known that our native oaks were subject
to excrescences of
different forms and
sizes, such, for example,
as oak-apples, oakleaf
galls, oak spangles, &amp;c.,
all of which were ascertained
to be caused
by several species of
<i>cynips</i>; but lately we
have to lament the introduction
of a new
species of the same
insect, forming a new
kind of gall, which, instead
of attacking the
backs of the leaves, as
does the oakleaf gall,
occupies the stem that
belongs to the leaf; in
fact, the attacked leaves seem to be converted into
bunches of galls, as represented in the adjoining
figure, which presents an illustration of the new
pest. They are hard galls, more or less like the
&#8220;nut-gall&#8221; from Aleppo, of which ink is made, and
it will be seen that the little twig supports no less
than five galls, in the interior of each of which may
be found the maggot or <i>larva</i> of an insect; and, as
this is affected at the expense of the buds and leaves,
the mode of injury must be obvious, as the new twigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which would have been formed, had there been no
galls, would in their turn have produced branches
and leaves. Trees thus infested are crippled as
though they had been subjected to constant pruning.</p>

<p>As much of the natural history of the <i>cynips</i>, by
which these gall-nuts are formed, as is necessary
for our purpose, may be gathered from a paper by
Mr. Parfitt, who seems to have well studied the gall
insect in Devon, its head-quarters. We quote it from
the Journal of the Bath and West of England Agricultural
Society for 1861:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The eggs deposited by the females in the oak buds in September
remain there in a state of apparent quiescence till the following
spring; then, as soon as the sap begins to flow, the irritant injected
into the wound at the same time the <i>egg</i> was deposited, or possibly
the combined action of the egg and irritant, causes the sap to diverge;
that portion of the bud which should have formed a young shoot is
converted into a spherical ball; the outer scales of the bud fall away,
and it is the woody secretion which entirely forms the gall. The
cells in the gall are not elongated and regular, as in the young shoot,
but confused and irregular; and in the centre of each gall lies a young
grub of the <i>cynips</i>, forming a living nucleus, around which is deposited
a thin, hard, woody envelope, much more compact in substance than
the sponge-like tissue which fills up the interstice between it and the
shining outer coat of the gall. This compactness of structure is a
necessary and all-wise provision of nature for protecting the delicate
insect which lies within from destruction; for if the gall were composed
entirely of large spongy cells, the rapid flow of sap in the early
spring would be more than the creature could consume, and it would
consequently be drowned. I am aware that some naturalists incline
to the opinion that the <i>larv&aelig;</i> of the <i>cynips</i> feed on the gall. From
this view, however, I venture to dissent; for not only is it inconsistent
with the structure of the creature&#8217;s mouth, and the position
in which the young <i>larv&aelig;</i> are invariably found, with the head tucked
under the apex of the abdomen, but if they fed on the substance or
crude material of the gall, the undigested parts would certainly be<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
found in the interior of its cell: in other words, the excrement would
be there, for there is no outlet, and the lacteals or absorbent vessels
of the gall could not take it up. I therefore think that the creature
feeds entirely on the sap of the tree&#8212;an elaborate food fit for it
without the need of mastication. This explains how it happens that
the galls of commerce, with the insects in them, are so much better
and dearer than those from which the <i>cynips</i> has escaped; in a word,
the tannic acid is more abundant.</p>

<p>It has been before observed, that there are two broods of the insect
in a season; thus, those which do not emerge from the gall in September
remain on till the following April or May. This is a wise
provision of nature for continuing the species, should anything befall
the autumn brood; and it is the more deserving of notice, because the
gall-producing <i>cynips</i> has a deadly enemy which accompanies or
follows it in its flight from bud to bud, and deposits an egg wherever
it finds the egg of the <i>cynips</i>. Here, as soon as the <i>cynips</i> larva is
hatched, the larva of the parasite is hatched also; forthwith the latter
proceeds to eat a hole in the skin of the rightful occupant of the
nidus, and the two larv&aelig; go on growing together till the <i>cynips</i> is
ready to assume the pupal state; then the parasite cuts the vital
thread of the <i>cynips</i>, and uses its skin for a pupal envelope for itself;
and thus, instead of the gall-fly emerging into day, a beautiful green
insect makes its appearance on the stage of life. I had the pleasure
of first discovering this parasite while engaged in studying the <i>cynips</i>;
it belongs to the genus <i>Callimone</i>, and from the fact of having discovered
it in Devonshire, I gave it the name of <i>Callimone Devoniensis</i>.
It is one of the handsomest of our British insects; its costume a
brilliant green, shot with gold; the abdominal segments green, gold,
and purple; legs yellow; tarsi reddish; and it has four beautiful
transparent and iridescent wings.</p>

<p>It has been stated that oak-galls are produced at the expense of
acorns. From this view my experience leads me to dissent. In
exceptional instances it may have been the case; but as a rule the
<i>cynips</i> confines its attacks to young trees and young growths in hedges,
within a range of ten or twelve feet from the ground, and the nearer
the ground the more numerous the galls. Young trees which have not
attained a greater height than that I have indicated suffer so much
that many of them can scarcely make headway against their foe; and
in several nurseries I have visited, where it might be expected that<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
greater care would be paid than in the case of ordinary plantations,
the young stock of oaks has been rendered quite unsaleable by the
pest. This year I have noticed the progress of the insect on two
groups of young English and Turkey oaks growing side by side; and
although there are hundreds of galls on the English oaks, there are
none on the Turkey oaks. From this I am led to infer that the
species of <i>cynips</i> now under notice is confined in its depredations to
the English oak; and as it invariably selects trees of younger or
restricted growth&#8212;probably because the temperature at a higher
elevation than ten or twelve feet from the earth is unfavourable to it&#8212;it
would seem that children might be advantageously employed in
young plantations in collecting the galls by means of cutting-hooks,
such as are used for thistles. The galls, when once collected, might
either be crushed for tanning purposes, or consumed by fire, and if
the process were repeated for two or three seasons, it is more than
probable that the plantation would be altogether free from the pest.</p></blockquote>

<p>These able remarks not only well describe the
nature of the attack, but also point to a cure&#8212;a
matter to which we would direct the most serious
attention of the planter; for we may state that, in
1853, we saw some very small oak trees, in the
neighbourhood of Dawlish, Devon, from which some
hundreds of these galls might have been gathered.
This was the first time we had noticed this pest,
though it appears that it had been under Mr. Parfitt&#8217;s
notice as long as a dozen years. Since then (1853)
we have traced it in its progress as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Having observed the galls in Devon in 1853, we
were yearly on the look-out in the Midland and
Eastern counties for its appearance, and the following
dates will show that its spread, though gradual, was
sufficiently rapid:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

</table>

<p>We have this season observed a lot of the young
galls; but last year, for the first time, we discovered
that, in many cases, the maggot had been extracted by
some small bird, one of the titmice (<i>Parus c&aelig;ruleus</i>);
and, if so, wherever young oaks may be growing, it
should afford an additional reason for the protection of
these useful birds. The magnitude of the evil, unless
checked by some means, may be estimated from
the fact that, in 1856, we could scarcely find half
a dozen galls within a wide district, and now all
around may be found trees, not more than 10 feet
high, upon which are no less than from one to five
hundred distinct galls.</p>

<p>We conclude these remarks upon our native oaks
with the fervent hope that in &#8220;Merry England&#8221; it
may ever be as described by dear old Chaucer:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE CHESTNUT AND WALNUT.</h4>

<p>The Chestnut and Walnut are here brought together,
not only as producing two useful kinds of hard-wooded
timber, but from the fact of both being
bearers of esteemed kinds of fruit. They are neither
grown to the same extent in England as on the Continent,
and probably neither of them is indigenous
to this country, although it is stated by Sir W.
Hooker to grow in woods apparently wild, in the
south and south-west of England. As regards the
fruit of the former, it may be said that in parts
of Spain &#8220;Spanish Chestnuts&#8221; are a staple article
of food. In England they are sometimes brought to
table as a stuffing for turkeys, or roasted for dessert;
but their greatest consumption among us is with the
poor, who, in winter, with a halfpenny-worth of
roasted chestnuts enjoy the double luxury of warm
fingers and a sweet nutritious diet. Walnuts, as a fruit,
are highly esteemed by all classes: as much by those
who crack and peel them in a second or third class
railway carriage, as by the squire who takes them as
a concomitant with his glass of port. With us they
are only cared for while they can be peeled, but
abroad they are carefully dried, in which state they
form an important article of commerce. In the
Portuguese court of the International Exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
1861, in our capacity of juryman, we had brought
before us specimens of dried walnuts from as many
as fifty exhibitors.</p>

<p>The Spanish chestnut (<i>Castanea vulgaris</i>) has no
relationship with the so-called horse-chestnut, which
latter, we might just mention, is solely employed
as an ornamental tree, if we except its occasional
use in cabinet-work. Evelyn, sixty years ago, speaks
of it as being &#8220;all the mode for the avenues to their
country palaces in France.&#8221; It has been much used
for this purpose with us, and its magnificent flowers
and fine foliage will ever recommend it as an ornament
about country residences.</p>

<p>But to return to the Spanish chestnut. This tree
is planted with us both for the growth of timber or
as underwood for poles; for the latter purpose it
answers well, as it soon grows up again after cutting,
and in its young state it goes so soon to heart-wood
that the poles are remarkably strong and
tough.</p>

<p>As a timber tree, the chestnut has been very
extensively extolled both in this country and on
the Continent; it may, however, be concluded that
although its wood is exceedingly useful, it has never
been put to the important uses which have been
claimed for it.</p>

<p>Evelyn, speaking of chestnut-wood, says:&#8212;&#8220;I had
once a very large barn near the city, framed entirely
of this timber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir T. D. Lauder tells us that the roof of the
Parliament House in Edinburgh is constructed of
chestnut, and we have often seen it stated that
the magnificent roof of Westminster Hall has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
framed of this timber;<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but to quote from Selby&#8217;s
admirable &#8220;History of British Forest Trees&#8221;:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The fact is, as Buffon first observed, the wood of the oak, more
particularly that of the sessile-fruited variety, assumes, in course of
time, a near resemblance in colour to that of the chestnut in its best
condition, or when young and untainted at heart; and as few
chestnuts could have acquired the scantling frequently observed in
the timbers of these ancient buildings at the age dialling or decay
almost invariably commences, this in itself furnishes a strong argument
against the use of chestnut timbers and beams by our ancestors,
inasmuch as the trees must become unfit for the purpose long before
they had attained the necessary dimensions.&#8212;P. 326.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

(chestnut) wood, as is the roof of Westminster Hall, built by
William Rufus, in the year 1099, still free from any appearance of
decay.&#8212;<i>Sylva Britannica</i>, p. 81.</p></div>

<p>But although we may safely dismiss the notion
that chestnut is of the value formerly supposed,
yet its timber is not without its uses; it is employed
for smaller beams, gate-posts, piles, and other purposes
where large timber is not required. Its best
use is for poles, for which purpose chestnut may be
employed as nurses to oak, thinning out the former
as growth advances.</p>

<p>Dismissing, however, the subject of the economic
value of the chestnut, whether for timber or fruit,
as an ornamental tree it has few equals. There
are many fine chestnut-trees in our country, but
perhaps the finest, as it is supposed to be the
oldest, sylvan veteran in England is the one at Tortworth,
in Gloucestershire, of which Strutt says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>In the reign of Stephen, who ascended the throne in 1135, it was
deemed so remarkable for its size, that, as appears upon record, it<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was well known as a signal boundary to the Manor of Tortworth.
At the time that it was thus conspicuous for its magnitude and
vigour, we may reasonably suppose it to have been in its prime; if,
therefore, we pay any regard to the received opinion which is applied
to the chestnut, equally with the oak, that it is three hundred years
in coming to perfection, this calculation takes us back to the beginning
of the reign of Egbert, in the year 800, for the commencement
of the existence of the Tortworth Chestnut.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well then may we exclaim with the poet<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hail, old patrician trees, so great and good!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>) is supposed to have
been introduced from Persia by the Romans; but
although we can have no claim to it as a native, yet
it has thriven so remarkably well, as for many years
since to have furnished us with a large quantity of
a highly valuable timber. So much indeed is its
wood esteemed, as to have caused its use only in the
better kinds of cabinet-work, such as drawing-room
furniture, internal fittings, and where mahogany
would now be considered as somewhat common; it
has, too, been ever esteemed as a wood for gun-stocks,
as it combines hardness, toughness, and an agreeable
colour with a great degree of lightness&#8212;being of a
less specific gravity than that of any other kind of
hard wood.</p>

<p>Fowling-pieces, gentlemen&#8217;s rifles, pistols, and all
the finer kinds of small arms, usually have stocks of
walnut, as its texture, colour, and the sharpness
with which fancy carvings can be worked, peculiarly
adapt it for the purpose.</p>

<p>During the continental war, English walnut
fetched an enormous price. Selby tells us that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
single tree was sold for &pound;600, owing to which many
of the noblest specimens were sacrificed; and Loudon
tells us that, about 1806, no less than 12,000 trees
were annually required for these uses in France.</p>

<p>In England this tree is principally grown for its
fruit, which is a great favourite when ripe as an
adjunct to the social glass. Still enormous quantities
are never allowed to attain to ripeness, from
their being used in a green state for the purposes of
pickling, sauces, and the like; indeed, so much is the
green part of the walnut esteemed for its flavouring
properties, that the very &#8220;hulls,&#8221; or coverings to the
ripened fruits, are employed as an ingredient in the
preparation of sauces and flavourings.</p>

<p>Another use of the fruit, especially on the Continent,
is that of making oil, which is considered to be
little, if at all, inferior to fine olive-oil.</p>

<p>The walnut-tree, then, may be considered as offering
many claims for its more extensive cultivation,
for although native growths of timber have been of
late years in a measure superseded by American
walnut and hickory wood, still it offers no mean
inducements to the planter upon this score alone, at
the same time it must be allowed that with us the
chief inducement to the culture of this tree is the
value of its fruit and the handsome tree which it
makes.</p>

<p>In the growth of this and the preceding, it is
always best to procure good, healthy, young trees
from the nurseryman; indeed, in planting all forest
trees this may be considered as not only the best, but
usually the cheapest mode of proceeding.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ELM.</h4>

<p>To the critical botanist the study of the different
kinds of Elm is one of the most perplexing subjects
he has to cope with, the fact being, that if the seed
of any one form be cultivated, the results will seldom
or never be uniform, for not only may several well-known
varieties be produced from the seed of a single
tree, but even new forms may thus be obtained.</p>

<p>On this account have arisen the great discrepancies
one meets with in authors as regards nomenclature;
some making many species of the Elms commonly
met with in Great Britain, while others reduce them
to two; viz.<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p><i>Ulmus campestris</i>&#8212;Small-leaved, Common Upright or
English Elm.<br />

<i>Ulmus montana</i>&#8212;Large-leaved, Spreading Scotch or
Wych Elm.</p></blockquote>

<p>But though these are the names used by most
authors to distinguish these two well-recognized forms,
yet they have been reversed in Dr. Arnott&#8217;s edition of
Hooker&#8217;s &#8220;Flora,&#8221; thus:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p><i>Ulmus suberosa</i> (Ehrh.)&#8212;Common or English Elm.<br />

<i>Ulmus campestris</i> (L.)&#8212;Broad-leaved or Wych Hazel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now it is not our object to enter into a discussion
on the much-vexed question of species, and therefore,
without even determining whether the English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Scotch Elms be absolutely distinct, we shall yet
describe as two well-established forms of forest trees,
and endeavour to put them in their proper position
among profitable and ornamental timber trees, to
which end we would distinguish them as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Ulmus campestris.</i>&#8212;The English Elm, though
not the producer of the most valuable timber, or of
a kind for more refined purposes, is still one of the
most extensively useful of any kind whatsoever. The
long straight balks of this Elm caused it at one
time to be employed for water-pipes; these can be
readily cut into boards of great length and width,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
which are useful for a variety of purposes. Selby
sums up an account of its character as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>The wood when matured is of a deep-brown colour, compact and
fine-grained; according to Loudon, it loses nearly two-thirds of its
weight in drying, as when cut it weighs nearly seventy pounds the
cubic foot, and when seasoned not more than twenty-eight pounds
and a half. In the lateral adhesion of its fibre it surpasses the
<i>U. montana</i>, though perhaps inferior to it in longitudinal toughness,
and therefore not capable of supporting so severe a cross strain. The
former property, however, eminently qualifies it for every purpose
where a strong wood that will not split or crack, either from concussion
or the action of sun and wet, is required; on this account,
Matthew, in his able treatise on naval timber, strongly recommends
it for the &#8220;blocks, dead-eyes, and other wooden furniture of rigging.&#8221;
In country carpentry it is very extensively used in all the Southern
parts of England; but the purposes to which it is applied it is
unnecessary to enumerate, these having already been described by
Evelyn and subsequent authors. Its durability under water, as well
as the straightness and great length of its stem, qualifies it for
making the keels of large ships, for which purpose it sells at a very
high price.</p></blockquote>

<p>As an ornamental tree for general purposes, few
can surpass the elm, as when well-grown and not
too much interfered with by the forester, it has a
gracefully aspiring form without a disposition to
lankiness: its foliage is thick enough to afford any
amount of shade, and yet is never of a heavy appearance.</p>

<p>It flourishes best in good deep soil, in which the
most solid balks are grown: when planted on poor
land or on gravel-beds it decays at the heart at a
very early age. Some of the English elms in Hyde
Park have thus decayed, whilst others have attained
a respectable size and age, having been injured by
storms:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wintry winds had passed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And swept an arm away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winter found a wound at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In which to work decay.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In good soil the English elm grows to an enormous
size, remaining perfectly solid to a good old age. We
remember the felling of a tree called &#8220;Piff&#8217;s Elm,&#8221;
on the high-road between Cheltenham and Tewkesbury,
in which the hole measured 28 feet in circumference
at 4 feet from the ground, and we counted
198 rings of annual growth. Still, when grown in
poor gravelly soils and in the usual hedge mode,
in which they are periodically shrouded and crippled,
they often begin to decay in the centre at less than
twenty years of age.</p>

<p>There are varieties of the <i>U. campestris</i>, which, as
they are not of any particular importance as timber
trees, need only be lightly touched upon in this
place. They are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>1. <i>Ulmus suberosa</i>&#8212;Cork Elm, bark of the limbs exceedingly
corky.<br />

2. <i>Ulmus carpinifolia</i>&#8212;Hornbeam-leaved Elm, leaves strongly-veined,
serratures blunt; branches nearly smooth.<br />

3. <i>Ulmus stricta</i>&#8212;Cornish Elm, leaves smooth and shining
above, doubly serrated, with obtuse teeth; branches
bright-brown, smooth, erect.<br />

4. <i>Ulmus glabra</i>&#8212;Small-leaved Elm, leaves small and smooth;
branches pendulous.</p></blockquote>

<p>2. <i>Ulmus montana.</i>&#8212;The Scotch Elm, the broad-leaved
elm (wych hazel) of most parts of England
and Scotland, is well distinguished by its large broad
leaves, hop-like fruits, large limbs diverging from
a less towering trunk at an obtuse angle, branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
more or less lax and pendulous, bark of the twigs
dark brown, smooth and not corky; of stem when
rough, not <i>suberose</i>.</p>

<p>This tree is reputed wild, but there seems reason to
think that this form, and certainly the <i>U. campestris</i>,
has been introduced. One reason for this conclusion
is that although the <i>U. montana</i> produces such an
enormous amount of seed, yet, in as far as we know,
none of this produces young trees, or, in other words,
this elm does not appear to increase sporadically.
Even in cultivation it is found to be exceedingly
difficult to replenish our nursery stock from seed, and
hence the cost of young plants, as they have to be
produced from suckers, or otherwise layered, and
occasionally grown from cuttings. Evelyn says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>It seems to be so much more addicted to some places than to others,
that I have frequently doubted whether it be a pure indigene or
translatitious; and not only because I have hardly ever known any
considerable woods of them (besides some few nurseries near Cambridge,
planted, I suppose, for store), but most continually in tufts,
hedge-rows, and mounds; and that Shropshire, and several other
counties, have rarely any growing in many miles together.&#8212;<i>Sylva</i>,
vol. i. p. 127.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this may be added the fact that the most
notable elm trees will usually be found at cross-roads&#8212;as
Maul&#8217;s Elm at Cheltenham, nearly 40 feet in circumference,
or about dwellings; the fine old trunk
at the Slade Farm, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, as
much as 50 feet, for some time hollow, and once used
as a cider-mill; the fine elms in our parks, as at
Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, and others; and
such avenues of elms as seen at Christchurch.</p>

<p>As a timber tree the Scotch elm is not esteemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
so highly as is the English sort. To begin with, it
does not grow such straight even balks; it is more
gnarled and knotty in sawing, and more difficult to
work. Selby says that Scottish writers have arrived
at a different conclusion, which he conceives to have
arisen from the fact that &#8220;their estimate has been
drawn from a comparison of the wood of <i>U. montana</i>
with that of <i>U. suberosa</i> (considered by them to be
the English elm), which produces a soft, spongy
wood, greatly inferior to most other trees of the
genus.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is used for flooring and rough country work.
The peculiar wen-like excrescences that one sometimes
meets with on the sides of wych elms are
carefully preserved and cut into veneers for fine
loo-tables, work-boxes, and other purposes, when a
peculiar mottled fine-coloured wood is required for
fancy-work.</p>

<p>Some of the finest elms we have examined have
been Maul&#8217;s elm, Piff&#8217;s elm, the Slade elm, before
mentioned, and the following, measured at one and
three feet from the ground.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV.</h3>

<h4>ON THE ASH, BEECH, AND OTHER WHITE-WOODED
TREES.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ash</span> (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>), when well-grown and
in good foliage, is one of our most charming trees;
its light, graceful, and agreeably-coloured leaves,
united with a graceful disposition of lithe, smoothly-formed
limbs, altogether fully entitle it to be considered
as the &#8220;Venus of the Forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The leaves of the common ash are pinnate, with
from three to four pairs of leaflets and one terminal
leaflet. This latter is sometimes absent when the
apex is bifoliate, and a form called the double-leaf is
produced, which even at this day is reputed by the
rustics to be capable of working various charms.</p>

<p>It is this pinnate pendent leaf which, loosely
hanging on the flexile, more or less pendent branches,
gives so much grace to the tree.</p>

<p>We have been much pleased with some groups of
ash trees in Earl Bathurst&#8217;s park (Oakley Park) at
Cirencester; but, as Strutt well observes,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>It is in mountain scenery that the ash appears to peculiar advantage;
waving its slender branches over some precipice which just
affords it soil sufficient for its footing, or springing between crevices
of rock, a happy emblem of the hardy spirit which will not be
subdued by fortune&#8217;s scantiness. It is likewise a lovely object by the
side of some crystal stream, in which it views its elegant pendent
foliage, bending, Narcissus-like, over its own charms.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>But charming as is the ash when in its most perfect
foliage, yet as its &aelig;stivation is usually so late, and
the fall of its leaves so early and rapid, it often
displays all but naked limbs, even amidst the freshness
of spring, as well as during the autumnal tinting
of almost all other trees. It would seem that its
buds cannot expand in spring frosts, whilst the first
frost of autumn will frequently make the whole
foliage drop in one mass beneath the influence of the
succeeding sunshine. This susceptibility to spring
cold is doubtless at the base of the country weather
predictions which are made to depend upon the
behaviour of the ash in respect to its time of displaying
its leaves:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the oak&#8217;s before the ash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may then expect a dash.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Generally held to mean, that if the leaves of the oak
are seen before those of the ash, a fine dry summer
may be expected; but, on the contrary,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With the ash before the oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may then expect a soak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The truth of all this may be that a cold wet spring,
which would retard the bursting of the buds of the
ash, may be expected to be followed by a fine
summer; whilst, on the contrary, a genial forward
spring is often succeeded by a wet summer.</p>

<p>Selby remarks on the early fall of the leaf, which,
as he says, is &#8220;after the first autumnal frost, however
early that may happen; and this, in general, without
undergoing any change of colour, or contributing by
the &#8217;sear and yellow leaf&#8217; to the waning beauty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
autumnal foliage.&#8221; On this account, Sir T. D.
Lauder recommends that &#8220;ash trees should be
sparingly planted around a gentleman&#8217;s residence,
to avoid the risk of their giving to it a cold, late
appearance, at a season when all nature should
smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>It should be noted that although the ash seems to
be so susceptible of cold, it nevertheless ripens its
seeds most perfectly in any part of Great Britain;
and besides this, these seeds, or &#8220;keys,&#8221; when
naturally sown, come up with the greatest certainty,
so that young ash may be removed from the wood
and used for planting.</p>

<p>This renders it easy to cultivate young plants from
seed; to which end, when the ripened keys are
gathered in the autumn, they should be well examined
to see that the seed has not been eaten out by the
ash-weevil, as it will most certainly be if a small
orifice be observable on one side of the key or samara,
just over the seed.</p>

<p>In growing ash with a view to profit, it is recommended
to plant it by itself in belts or plantations,
which are called ash-holts, as it usually, when well
started, grows upwards too fast to be a good nurse
to other trees, which latter would suffer from the
whipping of the longer heavy flexile stems of the
ash.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Selby says, &#8220;The pitting system should always be adopted in
planting the ash, for the roots, even in young plants, are too
numerous, large, and spreading, to be properly inserted by the
splitting or <span class="lettsymb">T</span> method.&#8221; We would also add, that they should be
planted as soon upon removal as possible.</p></div>

<p>It is too often planted in hedge-rows, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
exceedingly objectionable, not only from the ill effects
on the scene of interminable rows of one kind of
tree, but the drip and the peculiar growth of the
roots render it most destructive to the growth of
crops planted beneath its shade.</p>

<p>The uses to which the wood of this tree is turned
are multifarious in the extreme. Walking-sticks are
made from ash saplings; and as, from youth to age,
it is so tough and elastic, it is used for handles and
other parts of farm implements and machinery of all
kinds. The wheelwright and coachmaker employ the
wood extensively; so also the cooper. As a firewood
its &#8220;offal&#8221; is always welcome, as it burns with a
clear, bright flame, and that nearly as well in the
green as in the dry state; and the whole tree is
so rich in potash that this alkali is often made from
its trimmings and loppings.</p>

<p>We had already mentioned some of the superstitions
connected with the ash, and at p. 250 will be
found directions for making a shrew-ash; we shall
now, therefore, only direct attention to another practice
which this tree was employed for, even to a
somewhat recent period, as it will account for some
curious growths of ash which will sometimes be met
with. Evelyn says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>I have heard it affirmed with great confidence, and upon experience,
that the rupture to which many children are obnoxious, is
healed, by passing the infant through a wide cleft made in the bole
or stem of the growing ash-tree; it is then carried a second time
round the ash, and caused to repass the same aperture as before. The
rupture of the child being bound up, it is supposed to heal as the
cleft of the tree closes and coalesces.</p></blockquote>

<p>As, then, the healing of the child would seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
depend upon that of the tree, this potent charm is
not always successful, as may be gathered from the
fact that young trees have been met
with which never healed at all, and we
recollect one of these, of which the
accompanying <a href="#HoleFig">wood-cut</a> is a copy,
having been presented at a Conversazione
of the Worcestershire Natural
History Society. The tree from whence
it was taken was of about ten years of
age. Selby says that an instance of
this use of the ash is &#8220;related by the
Rev. T. Bree, in the <i>Magazine of
Natural History</i>, where a ruptured
child was made to pass through the
chasm of a young ash-tree, split for
the purpose, in Warwickshire.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="HoleFig" id="HoleFig"></a>
<img src="images/illo336.png" alt="Hole in ash" width="100" height="497" />
</div>

<p>These facts seem to point to the
acting upon such superstitions to within
a comparatively recent period, though
doubtless the drawing a child beneath
the stolon or shoot of a bramble that
has rooted at its extremity, and which
we have known to be gravely recommended
by a wise (!) woman, would
be equally efficacious, and, upon the
whole, easier to perform.</p>

<p>Evelyn further says that &#8220;the chemists exceedingly
commend the seed of the ash to be an admirable
remedy for the stone.&#8221; &#8220;But,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;whether
by the power of magic or nature, I determine not.&#8221;
We would suggest that it was by the power its roots
possess of riving the natural rock. So stone-crop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
from decomposing the stones on which it grows, was
held to have the like effect. How strange, then, it
is that with such evidences of the truth of the
motto,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Similia similibus curantur,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>physicians of the present day should refuse to listen
to this still (and very small) voice of nature, and not
all become hom&#339;opaths! Such may well be the
reasoning of many an old woman who still pretends
to cures either by magic spells or infinitesimal
globules.</p>

<p>Two interesting varieties of ash are met with: the
pendulous or weeping-ash, which, Sir W. Hooker
informs us, is said to have been first discovered in a
field at Gamlingay, and the <i>Fraxinus heterophylla</i>, in
which the leaf is simple, that is, it is in one piece,
more the form of a laurel-leaf than the usual
pinnated ash-leaf. These variations are easily perpetuated
by grafting, and are here only mentioned on
account of their peculiar habits.</p>

<hr class="c05" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Beech</span> (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) is admitted by all
authors to be a native of Great Britain, and if the
many magnificent giants one here and there meets
with be admitted as proofs of indigenous origin, few
trees can put in a more imposing claim. The celebrated
Burnham beeches, so well known to artists
and lovers of nature in general, and the many fine
examples of this tree in the Cotteswolds, upon which
range it is said to grow as a weed, testify to the age
and size to which the beech may attain.</p>

<p>The plantations of beeches in Oakley Park are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
worthy of note in speaking of the Cotteswolds, for
although they have been planted here, yet the fine,
tall, clean balks, lofty tops, and the &#8220;twilight
shades&#8221; beneath, will not soon be forgotten by the
author, who, beneath their boughs, through the
liberality of Earl Bathurst, &#8220;has felt them all his
own,&#8221; as says the poet Gray of the Burnham beeches.
Here, too, has he mused, though not, like Pope, in
&#8220;thoughts that burn,&#8221; yet much wondering at the
curious plants which choose such seclusion for their
dwelling. Of these the following may be here
enumerated, as they really form part of the natural
history of the beech wood:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p><i>Listera Nidus-avis</i>&#8212;Birds&#8217;-nest Orchis.<br />

<i>Habenaria chlorantha</i>&#8212;Butterfly Orchis.<br />

<i>Epipactis grandiflora</i>&#8212;Large White Helleborine.<br />

<i>Epipactis ensifolia</i>&#8212;Narrow-leaved White Helleborine.<br />

<i>Epipactis latifolia</i>&#8212;Broad-leaved Helleborine.<br />

<i>Monotropa Hypopithys</i>&#8212;Yellow Birds&#8217;-nest.<br />

<i>Pyrola minor</i>&#8212;Lesser Winter Green.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a list of plants found in the beech woods is
sufficient to make their locality remarkable, and if we
add to them the</p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p><i>Tuber cibarium</i>&#8212;Truffle,<br />

<i>Morchella esculenta</i>&#8212;Morell,<br />

<i>Elaphomyces muricatus</i>&#8212;Sharp-warted <i>Elaphomyces</i>,</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8212;these, with various other curious fungi, will be
sufficient to make Oakley Park and its beeches a
botanical habitat of no mean pretension.</p>

<p>As regards the truffle, we may mention that we
have heard that a former Earl Bathurst kept dogs for
the purpose of hunting them. We have partaken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the morells from this park several times, and always
found them delicious, and can recommend them
stuffed with sausage-meat and fried, as a dish for an
epicure: we have seen them exposed for sale in the
greengrocers&#8217; shops of the good old town of Cirencester.</p>

<p>But we are sadly digressing from the subject of the
beech tree in his history as a forest and ornamental
tree. Under the latter aspect, then, most authors,
except Gilpin, view the beech to hold a very high
place. Coleman, in his &#8220;Woodlands,&#8221; considers
that,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Among our truly indigenous forest-trees, the beech must certainly
rank as second only to the oak for majesty and picturesqueness;
while, for the union of grace and nobility, it may claim precedence
over every other member of our sylva.</p>

<p>Having said this, we must, as a matter of course, dissent from the
opinion of Gilpin, the highly-gifted author of &#8220;Forest Scenery,&#8221; who
has, as we think, unjustly impugned the ornamental character of this
generally favourite tree, and this because he had some crotchets of
his own about landscape composition, and the shape that trees ought
to take to make them good subjects for the pencil. The beech did
not happen to fit itself to his theory, and so he quarrelled with it,
and called it hard names.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any one who has ever seen a well-grown beech
tree, such as was once our delight to visit at Hartley
Bottom, near the source of the Thames, or who has
seen such masses of beech glowing with autumnal
tints as may be witnessed in a journey on the Great
Western Railway between Swindon and Cheltenham,
will never speak disparagingly of the beech, which
we think noble, alike by itself as in masses, or as a
sylvan denizen with other trees.</p>

<p>But it has other claims besides that of ornament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
it is a highly useful wood, much employed in carpentry,
cabinet-work, and turnery; in the making of
charcoal; and increasingly so in the manufacture of
wood-spirit.</p>

<p>As a firewood it excels most others, as it burns
with a clear flame, even when wet, and leaves behind
only a small quantity of ash. How, indeed, could it
possess much ash when it flourishes in positions
where scarcely four inches of soil covers up the
oolitic stone, its roots spreading over the rock and
occasionally dipping into its fissures in a manner
most aptly illustrative of the fact that this tree really
derives but little nutrition from the soil, the rocks
upon which it grows, for the most part, serving to
moor the giant in position that it may spread forth
its leaves to feed upon the atmosphere?</p>

<p>The beech is easily propagated from its fruit&#8212;&#8220;mast&#8221;&#8212;which,
indeed, so readily grows beneath
the trees that thousands might be obtained for the
purpose of pricking out in nursery lines, if looked
after. The usual method of cultivation is to gather
the mast in the autumn, to keep it well in sand, and
sow in the spring. After two years it is pricked out
in nursery rows, and is fit for planting in three years
more.</p>

<p>Where once established it will soon spread, as the
mast grows sporadically with great readiness, and
this tree has a faculty for extending undisputed
possession; thus, in America will be found wide-extended
forests of scarcely anything but beech,
which, though perhaps a little varied from our own,
is yet doubtless of the same species.</p>

<p>There are several ornamental varieties of beech to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
be obtained from the nurserymen, some of which are
more curious than useful; but we must not omit to
mention the Copper Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, var.
<i>purpurea</i>). This, judiciously disposed, is capable of
affording a great charm to the wood, and more especially
in plantations near the homestead. They are
fast-growing trees, and at present are here and there
to be met with of considerable size. We once possessed
a couple on our lawn, the largest of which
must have been nearly six feet in circumference; and
what from its colour, the thickness of its foliage, and
the fine sweep of its branches, it was capable of
yielding shade and shelter of a most perfect and
agreeable kind.</p>

<p>The drip of the beech is prejudicial to cultivation,
we think, from the circumstance that the hard,
though thin, leaves are so difficult of decomposition
that where they fall they leave a thick carpet covering
up the ground. If, then, these trees are in such a
position as to do mischief from this cause, the leaves
should be removed, and they will, if stored, be found
very useful in making hotbeds, linings to pots, and
other gardening work.</p>

<p>Beech is less liable to insect attacks than almost
any other tree; the most annoying is that of the
<i>Aphis</i>, especially when near the house, as this
harbours insects of all kinds, and the exuding
honey-dew much injures the aspect of the tree.</p>

<p>Beech timber would be more valuable than it is
were it not for its liability, when in panels, tables,
and furniture, to be attacked and bored by weevils.
We once had our house so infested with these little
beetles, derived from some furniture of this wood, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to cause considerable alarm; but fortunately our
domestic&#8217;s knowledge of natural history in the matter
of bugs was somewhat defective, as she had mistaken
the nature of the weevil. This pest can be removed
by boiling in oil; but it is a great drawback to the
use of a wood which otherwise might be applied to
various domestic purposes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.</h3>

<h4>ON SOFT-WOODED FOREST TREES.</h4>

<p>In this chapter we shall shortly direct attention to
such soft-wooded trees as the sycamore, plane, horse-chestnut,
lime, willow, poplar, and others, which,
though commonly grown, are yet more so for ornament
than profit; for though their woods are found
to be more or less useful, as a general rule they must
take a comparatively low rank as timber trees.</p>

<p>Both the Sycamore and the Plane are introduced
trees; both attain to a large size; and when judiciously
mixed with other trees form a very pleasing contrast.
The plane has the property of withstanding the
effects of smoke in towns better than any other tree,
and therefore it is recommended for planting in
public parks and town enclosures.</p>

<p>The Horse-Chestnut has much of the character of
the above; it grows tall and large, and its fine foliage
and handsome bunches of flowers are very attractive.
It is an excellent tree for shade, and has the merit of
quick growth; but its wood is so brittle as to cause
great limbs to be too readily blown off with a high wind.</p>

<p>The Lime (<i>Tilia Europ&aelig;a</i>) is one of our most
charming native trees, for so it has been pretty
clearly proved to be by E. Lees, Esq., F.L.S., who
says &#8220;that at Shrawley, eight miles north from Worcester,
there is a wood, remote from any dwelling or
public road, of about five hundred acres in extent, the
greater part of the undergrowth of which is composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of <i>Tilia Europ&aelig;a</i>, var. <i>Microphylla</i>;&#8221; and the same
gentleman, in a communication to the Botanical
Society of London, mentioned several places, in Worcestershire,
Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Monmouthshire,
and South Wales, where he considers the lime
to be indigenous, and where he met with many
remarkable and aged trees.</p>

<p>We shall not here enter into a discussion about
species, but, from what we saw in Shrawley wood and
its district, we incline to the belief that several names
made to depend mainly upon the leaves, might well
be omitted, seeing that from Shrawley itself the leaves
on the newly-sprung underwood are fully five times
larger than those on an old tree.</p>

<p>Putting such questions aside, we may well consider
the lime as a truly ornamental tree, <i>whose varieties</i>
give great charm to the forest or the more limited
plantation about the homestead, where its shade, its
perfume when in flower, and patience under lopping
and training, must ever recommend it.</p>

<p>The Willow, though usually cultivated in the shape
of twigs for basket-making and the like purposes, for
which many species are employed, is nevertheless
grown upon the margins of streams and in damp
places about estates and farms for its lop, which is
much used for hurdle-bonds, thatching-spars, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Amongst implements from this tree, the willow-wand
of the cricketer has now a fame in the New as
well as in the Old world, and long may its magic
continue to develope the muscle and sharpen the
faculties of the youth of Old England; whilst well-developed
muscle cannot better maintain its tone
than by a well-contested game of cricket.</p>

<p>In good situations the White Willow (<i>Salix alba</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
attains to very magnificent proportions. One at
Siddington, near Cirencester, measures 22 feet in
girth, at one foot from the ground; 18 ft. 6 in. at
three feet; and 20 ft. 6 in. at six feet. The principal
limb measured 12 ft. 6 in., and the circumference of
its fine top is as much as 72 feet. And four trees by
the Roman Amphitheatre at Cirencester, average
somewhere about 12 feet round at six feet from the
ground. Trees of this size, from their light, silvery
foliage, give great character to the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>These soft-wooded trees, with some poplar and
other ornamental trees, furnish a more or less light,
soft, spongy wood, very inferior for timber, but yet
capable of being put to various uses in turnery,
internal work, &amp;c., in which white wood is employed.</p>

<p>The <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> (Cone-bearers).&#8212;The Fir tribe may
well form a subject even for a separate volume, for
not only are some of them employed as timber trees,
but many are grown for their curious and interesting
structure.</p>

<p>The <i>Pinetum</i> has become to be a matter of amusement
to many a country gentleman throughout the
country; and in these are collected such new forms
as may in time become useful to the planter, as well
as such minute species as may illustrate the natural
history of a subject well worthy of extended study.</p>

<p>Amongst our giants of this natural order may be
placed the yew (which has been made a separate order
under the name of <i>Taxace&aelig;</i>) and the cedar; the
spruce-fir, Scotch-pine, and larch being the more
useful members as timber trees.</p>

<p>The Yew (<i>Taxus baccata</i>) is generally considered
as an indigenous tree, and as we can certainly point
to individuals that must have weathered nearly, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
not quite a thousand years, we are not disposed to
quarrel with the conclusion. Its former use in the
construction of the English long-bow is now obsolete,
and so too has almost died out the taste for growing
this tree to torture into grotesque shapes. Still, as a
picturesque tree in woodland and home scenery, and
even as an attendant upon the parish church, we
should like to see the yew more extensively grown.
It is also a most useful tree for close hedges and
blinds in the garden, as it will bear being clipped
within due bounds with a great amount of patience.</p>

<p>The Cedar (<i>Cedrus Libani</i>), which was probably
introduced to this country towards the end of the
seventeenth century, has yet made such progress as to
rival in size and importance many of our more stately
native timber trees of far greater age.</p>

<p>Amongst the more stately examples of this tree,
we may mention those at the Chelsea Botanical
Garden. There are some fine groups in Oakley Park,
Cirencester, growing on almost a bare rock of the
Great or Bath Oolite, and in the bleak Cotteswold
country, attaining the circumference of from 10 to 12
feet, at three feet from the ground. Long may the
cedar be cultivated for the size and beauty to which
it can attain, in which, perhaps, it may yet be
excelled by the <i>Cedrus deodara</i>, not many years since
introduced from the Himalayas. We rejoice to see
such noble specimens of vegetation grown, independent
of profit, which, indeed, is scarcely needed by a princely
possessor of a fine estate handed down, perhaps, from
generation to generation, in which each tree may
have a history of its own.</p>

<p>The Spruce-Fir (<i>Abies excelsa</i>) is an elegant tree
in composition, and grows well on the thinnest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
poorest soils. Its upright, tapering mode of growth
renders it a good nurse, with beech, larch, and other
<i>Conifer&aelig;</i>. It may be planted thickly; the first thinning
being used for hop-poles, the next for spars, masts,
&amp;c.; and ultimately a few may be left to attain size
and height as shelter and for effect.</p>

<p>The Scotch Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) is a native of
North Britain, where its fine trees in large forests or
in great clumps, form a peculiar and at times magnificent
appearance. It is much used in planting in
this country, principally as a nurse; but its young
sticks are not so durable as those of the spruce, and
much inferior to the larch. Its larger wood forms
the red deal&#8212;a timber so much used in all kinds of
carpentry as to give this tree a high value among
timber trees.</p>

<p>The Larch (<i>Larix Europ&aelig;a</i>) is a deciduous tree of
the order, and though it has not been introduced
into general use for very many years, yet its value is
daily becoming more fully developed; and as a tree
for general plantation, either as a nurse or in belts, it
has few, if any, equals. As a curious tree, it appears
to have been grown early in the eighteenth century,
and some fine trees are noticed by Selby at Dalwick
in Peeblesshire, and at Monzie in Argyleshire. The
largest larch which we have noticed was one which
was felled in Oakley Park.</p>

<p>It had previously been injured by being struck with
lightning, by which large pieces of the bark had been
torn away. We examined it at Lord Bathurst&#8217;s
desire, when it was found to be bored into from the
base of the trunk to as high as we could see, by that
curious insect the <i>Sirex gigas</i>, whose hornet-like
appearance causes so much consternation in the pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
forests in Germany, from which it is often introduced
into the dwellings of the peasant with fir logs. It is
quite as large as the hornet, and much of the same
bright colours, but its apparent sting of more than
half an inch in length is only an ovipositor, so that
that formidable-looking creature is perfectly harmless
after all. This tree was nearly twelve feet in circumference,
at three feet from the ground, in which condition
its lower drooping branches give the larch a
fine picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>Larches, and, indeed, the whole of the <i>Conifer&aelig;</i>,
are best procured for planting from the nursery, and
much time will ultimately be saved by planting them
as soon after removal as possible, and that by the pit
method; and so done, larch, unlike most other young
trees, shoots away at once, and soon allows of thinning
to profit.</p>

<p>We now bring this subject to an end, for the want
of space; but we cannot part with friends we love so
much without a benediction; in the words of Cowley
then we say,<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW GOOD ORCHARDS</h2>

<hr class="c05" />

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE APPLE AND PEAR AS ORCHARD FRUITS.</h4>

<p>In discussing the subject of fruit in relation to the
farm, we shall find that the number of species is
exceedingly limited, being, indeed, confined to two:
the apple and the pear. This paucity of species,
however, is amply compensated for in an extended and
constantly extending list of <i>sorts</i>, or varieties, which,
in both species, amount to several hundreds.</p>

<p>The apple, which we shall first describe, is admitted
on all hands to be derived from the wild crab-apple
(<i>Pyrus malus</i>), which is considered to be a native
tree, to which position its general appearance in
woods and hedges all over the island would seem to
give it no small claim.</p>

<p>The fruit of the crab is exceedingly austere, and
hence sour-tempered people are said to be &#8220;crabbed.&#8221;
The expressed juice makes a strong vinegar, called
&#8220;Verjuice&#8221;&#8212;in the vulgar, &#8220;Varjes&#8221;&#8212;and hence
Akerman, in his &#8220;Wiltshire Tales,&#8221; has given a cross-grained
woman the name of &#8220;Mistress Varjes.&#8221;
Verjuice is a very popular remedy for sprains and
bruises, and hence on most farms having trees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
crab-apples, the fruit is made into vinegar, and kept
separately for medicinal or domestic use.</p>

<p>The wild crab is very various in the size, colour,
and flavour of its fruit, varying in the latter point
from an austerity that, on biting an apple, would
make one wince again, to that of an agreeable acid
flavour, almost equal to some of our domestic apples.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration this disposition to run
into varieties, even in a wild state, we shall not be
surprised that, in cultivation, the sorts of apples
should be endless, so much so, indeed, that Don, in
his &#8220;General System of Gardening and Botany,&#8221; has
copied a list<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in which are described no less than one
thousand four hundred sorts, and in a nurseryman&#8217;s
list now before us, &#8220;Descriptive Catalogue of Fruit
Trees, by John Scott, of Merriott Nurseries, Crewkerne,
Somerset,&#8221; are described as many as one
hundred and sixty-six sorts, which he is prepared
to supply to purchasers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> This list was made out by the Horticultural Society in 1832,
and may now be considerably augmented.</p></div>

<p>As an evidence of the facility with which new sorts
can be obtained, there is scarcely a country town or
place in orchard districts but has given its name to
some apple. Thus we have Canadian Pippin, Newtown
Pippin, Carlisle and Keswick Codlin, Hawthenden,
&amp;c.; and the names of fruit-growers and
others attached to apples is almost endless; as thus:
Ashmead&#8217;s Kernel, Nelson&#8217;s Codlin, Lucombe&#8217;s
Seedling, Lord Nelson, Lord Raglan, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The subject of &#8220;sorts,&#8221; as applied to fruit, is one
of great interest, as the facility with which these can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
be obtained renders it possible to procure fruit
possessing very different properties and capabilities,
adapted, not only to a great variety of uses, but with
powers of adaptation to different soils, and a wide
range of climatic differences.</p>

<p>These powers of adaptation have, indeed, resulted
in the preservation of many sorts, but it also causes
the neglect of some others; for as fashion takes up
with new favourites old ones are neglected until they
die out, and, if not become entirely lost, their stocks
are lessened, so that the chance of a good choice for
their continuance becomes more difficult year by year.
We believe this to have more to do with the decline
of old favourites than any inherent principle of decay
with which grafts are said to be endowed.</p>

<p>The many sorts of apples differing so much in
flavour and keeping powers, enable this fruit to be
employed for a variety of purposes, such as<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p><i>Culinary Apples</i>, used for tarts, puddings, &amp;c., &amp;c.;<br />

<i>Dessert Apples</i>, usually of a sweet sub-acid flavour and crisp
texture, eaten raw;<br />

<i>Cider Apples</i>, the expressed juice of which forms English
Cider (<i>Cidre</i>, French).</p></blockquote>

<p>The same distinctions apply to pears, with the difference
that their juice is termed Perry.</p>

<p>Now, with regard to the two first, we need here only
mention them incidentally, as their description belongs
more properly to the horticulturist, or pomologist,
than to the farmer; at the same time it must be
confessed that both culinary and dessert apples
may be made a source of profit by the farmer, as
they would always find ready purchasers; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
difficulty a farmer meets with in their cultivation
results from the circumstance that it is not easy to
exert that watchfulness over broad acres necessary to
protect sweet apples from the predatory urchins with
which every country parish abounds, a propensity,
indeed, not sufficiently checked by the elders, whose
plea that &#8220;it is only a few apples, and that children
will be children,&#8221; affords just that amount of encouragement
which too often ends in more serious
acts of larceny.</p>

<p>As regards cider fruit, we would here dissent from
the common belief that sour apples are the best for
cider-making. We believe that the sweeter the
apple, and the higher the specific gravity of the juice,
the better the cider. Many, then, of our culinary and
dessert apples would make most excellent drink; at
the same time there are many sorts that will not
&#8220;cook,&#8221; whose flesh cannot be got to become soft and
pulpy, but rather hard and tough by the processes
either of boiling or baking. Many sorts whose flavour
is not sufficiently agreeable to be eaten raw, and yet
these may yield on expression a sweet juice, resulting
in a strong and agreeable cider.</p>

<p>Now, although there can be little doubt but that
the quality of cider is much influenced by the sort
of fruit from which it is made, we are inclined to
the belief that the nature of the soil has, if possible,
a still more decided influence upon the result. We
therefore now direct attention to some of the best
cider districts in England, which may be classed as
follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>Devonshire, Cider of the sweetest and richest kind;<br />

Somersetshire, Cider rich and not so sweet;<br />

<span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Dorsetshire, Cider somewhat poor;<br />

Herefordshire, Cider and Perry, very strong, but somewhat
harsh;<br />

Worcestershire, Perry and Cider, rich and not too harsh;<br />

Gloucestershire, Cider and Perry, strong but not sweet.</p></blockquote>

<p>The prevailing geological formations of these cider-producing
counties may be arranged as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>1. Oolite Sands&#8212;Dorset, and parts of Somerset.<br />

2. Lias&#8212;Gloucester, Somerset, and Dorset.<br />

3. New Red Sandstone&#8212;Worcester, Devon and Hereford,
in part.<br />

4. Old Red Sandstone&#8212;Hereford and Devon.<br />

5. Silurian System&#8212;Hereford, in part.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hence, then, cider and perry are grown on the
sub-soils of five geological substrata, if, indeed, No. 1
should not here be classed with No. 2, for the extent
of orcharding upon the inferior oolite sands of Somerset
and Dorset is rather due to its extension from the
contiguous lias, and this on account of an occasional
depth and tenacity of soil. Its produce, however, is
usually inferior.</p>

<p>In Gloucestershire orchards always stop when the
top of the lias is reached, and it is curious to see the
sides of the Cotteswolds occupied with well-to-do
orchards until the oolite is reached, and then they
cease altogether, except in some few instances, which
are here referred to by way of warning.</p>

<p>Gloucestershire, for our present purpose, may be
said to rest on liassic valleys and oolitic hills. In
the valleys are small farms with small enclosures,
much of which is in orchard and meadow, whilst on
the hills are large farms with fields of from 30 to 100
acres devoted to arable cultivation. Hence, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
this has brought about two sets of farms: the vale,
with its fruits and dairy stock, producing good cider,
perry, butter, and cheese; the hills, mutton, wool,
roots, barley, &amp;c. Now, it happens as a rule that
the hill farmer stands higher in his profession than
he of the vale, for on the hills he can say<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The skill and enterprise in breeding the magnificent
Cotteswold sheep, for which there is each year
such a spirited competition, attest to this fact.</p>

<p>No sooner, then, does a vale farmer become possessed
of sufficient capital than he moves to the hills,
and as in his former residence he had imbibed a love
for cider, his first act will be to plant an orchard at
his new home; but, alas! the most successful farmer
cannot command crops in an uncongenial soil, and so
it is not surprising that we should know of instances
where not even enough fruit for an annual apple
pudding has been produced from a Cotteswold orchard
which had been planted thirty years.</p>

<p>Apples only attain to perfection on deep tenacious
soils, and in a genial climate; the moment the roots
get down to stones, the ends of the branches begin to
decay, and they become covered over with lichens as
thickly as in wet ill-drained clays; besides this the
trees look old and knotty, even in youth, a sure sign
that they are not sufficiently nourished. These facts
are so well known that in planting in our gardens we
prepare the soil, if not sufficiently deep and good, and
make the climate more genial by fencing and planting
in sheltered situations; but this is not possible on a
large scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>Pears prefer a lighter soil than apples, the new red
sandstone deposit, especially, the marls of this rock
and the lias clays, when covered up, as in parts of the
valley of the Severn, with sand drifts, suit pears
admirably.</p>

<p>Like the apple, the pear is rich in sorts. It is said
to be derived from the <i>Pyrus communis</i>, which is
referred to as a native tree; but though it is really
wild in the temperate regions of the European continent,
and in parts of Asia, there seems reason to
conclude that our occasional hedge-row denizen has,
after all, been derived from pear cultivation.</p>

<p>Pears for dessert are very numerous, and each year
adds to the list. Scott, of Crewkerne and Yeovil
Nurseries, gives a list of two hundred and thirty sorts
cultivated by himself, as Standards, Pyramids, and
Dwarf-trained for walls and espaliers. This list
abounds in French names given by both French and
Dutch horticulturists, with whom the pear is a great
favourite.</p>

<p>Lindley, in his &#8220;Guide to the Orchard and Kitchen
Garden,&#8221; describes but six sorts of perry pears, of
which there are doubtless several varieties. They are
as follows:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p class="center">ORIGIN OF NAMES.</p>

<p><i>Barland</i>, from Barland, in the parish of Bosbury, Herefordshire.<br />

<i>Holmore</i>, from the parish of Holmore, between Hereford
and Leominster.<br />

<i>Huffcap</i>.<br />

<i>Longland</i>, from the field in which the tree grew.<br />

<i>Oldfield</i>, from Oldfield, near Ledbury.<br />

<i>Teinton Squash</i>, from Teinton, in Gloucestershire.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>Besides these are Blakeney Red Trump Pear,
Honey Pear, Moorcroft, Malvern Hill, &amp;c. Pears,
like apples, being named from places and people,
&amp;c., each district having its own favourite sorts; but
perhaps those in the previous list are the favourite.</p>

<p>This subject of variety in both apple and pear is
interesting, as it has given rise to innumerable names
upon this head. My old pupil, Mr. Clement Cadle,
says:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>It is almost impossible to give satisfactory information on the sorts
of fruit, because the same sort is not only known by different names
in different localities, but it also assumes a widely different character
under the influence of broad distinctions of soil and climate, and this
is more frequently the case with pears than apples. In a tour I
made last autumn in the south of Devonshire, I visited several farms
in the neighbourhood of Totnes and Paignton, and amongst a great
number of sorts that I there saw, I could in no instance recognize
either an apple or tree as being like those I had seen before in
Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, or Worcestershire.</p>

<p>In selecting for producing cider or perry it is very important, not
only to get those kinds which suit the district, but to get a variety
in their character, especially for making good cider. Thus, some of
the apples should be sour, others sweet, bitter-sweet, tart, and harsh,
as much of the keeping character of the cider depends upon this
mixture, which also makes it fine down well. It may be remarked
that sweet or eating sorts of pears seldom make perry that will keep
any length of time, or that fines well.</p>

<p>There is another peculiar feature in regard to sorts of fruit, namely,
that each variety has its day, then gradually dies out. The trees
become non-bearers, and their places are filled with new sorts. This
is especially the case with the Hagloe crab, Fox whelp, and Skryme&#8217;s
kernel, which seldom bear or grow well now, and are nearly gone.</p>

<p class="rightsig"><i>R. A. S. Journal S.S.</i>, vol. <span class="allsmcaps">I.</span> pp. 18, 19.</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards pears, it should be stated that, while in
Worcester, Gloucester, and Hereford much perry is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
made, and it is highly esteemed, especially for bottling,
in Dorset this drink is almost unknown, and we were
last year greatly surprised that a farmer who had an
immense crop of pears of a sort that were not fit for
dessert or culinary purposes, could not divine what
to do with them, though he made excellent cider.</p>

<p>We conclude this portion of our subject with a
quotation from the Botanical Looker-out, by our old
friend and fellow worker, E. Lees, Esq.:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>A pear orchard in exuberant flower is a vegetable spectacle not
easily matched, for the bending branches of the pear tree give a gracefulness
to its outline far exceeding the stiff formality of the apple
tree, and oppressed with a multitudinous crowd of blossoms its branches
almost trail the ground, a bending load of beauty that seems by moonlight
a mass of silvery ingots. The Barland Orchard, between Worcester
and Malvern, containing more than seventy trees, lofty as
oaks, cannot be seen by a traveller without admiration, and is the
finest in the kingdom, though the trees are now getting old.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3>

<h4>ON THE PRODUCTION AND CHOICE OF FRUIT TREES.</h4>

<p>Although new sorts of fruits are easily obtainable
from seeds, yet this method of production is much too
slow for general purposes, and when kernel trees&#8212;that
is those raised from seed&#8212;are in the slow
progress of such events brought to produce fruit, it
is ten to one if it be of any value; so that even
seedling trees, when they have attained sufficient
size, are best used for stocks upon which to graft
any desired sort.</p>

<p>In reproducing a constant supply of well-known
sorts of fruit, three plans are usually practised,
namely, <i>Budding</i>, <i>Grafting</i>, and <i>Cutting</i>.</p>

<p><i>Budding</i> is usually employed in the case of smaller
fruit or flower trees, and but seldom with apples
and pears; this well-known process, however, is
frequently had recourse to in the nursery; it is
performed for fruit trees in the same way as for
roses, and therefore needs no description in this
place, as we can scarcely conceive the farmer doing
much in this direction, except as a matter of amusement
and experiment.</p>

<p><i>Grafting</i> is a common process on most farms with
orcharding; a sort of fruit may be wished to be
changed or a promising tree may be broken, and in
either case the farmer should know enough of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
process of grafting to be able to do it himself or else
to properly direct others.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="GraftFig" id="GraftFig"></a>
<img src="images/illo359.png" alt="Graft and stock" width="207" height="400" />
<p class="caption">1. The Graft.<br />
2. The Stock.</p>
</div>

<p>In grafting, the first thing to be done is to secure
good shoots from a healthy tree of
the sort you wish to grow&#8212;these
are called the &#8220;grafts.&#8221; The stem
to receive the graft is called the
stock. Now a stock may be single,
in which case one graft will be
sufficient, as in the accompanying
<a href="#GraftFig">diagram</a>, or if an old tree has to
be grafted, a graft may be inserted
on as many branches as may seem
desirable. Our <a href="#GraftFig">diagram</a> represents
the common practice of side
grafting, but different plans are adopted according
to the difference in size of the stock on the one
hand, and the graft on the other, the principle to be
aimed at in the process being to get <i>as complete an
apposition of as much of the wood and bark of the
graft, with that of the stock, as is possible by careful
cutting and fitting</i>, and the tact and delicacy in
manipulating this matter make that successful
result which marks the good grafter. In this as
in other matters, practice and experience ensure
success; and hence it is usually found expedient to
employ a person who makes it his profession, and
such are always to be obtained in cider countries.</p>

<div class="figc125"><a name="BasketFig" id="BasketFig"></a>
<img src="images/illo360.png" alt="Protective basket on graft" width="125" height="428" />
<p class="caption">Graft protected by a
Wicker basket.</p>
</div>

<p>When the grafts have been fitted, they must be
kept in place by some plastic material, and that most
commonly used is a compost of cow-dung and clay,
well kneaded together, or merely chopped hay and
clay; this is pressed round the united parts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
form of a ball, and in cases where every care is taken
the graft may be further protected
by a wicker basket, as in the <a href="#BasketFig">diagram</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cutting.</i>&#8212;The ease with which
apple trees can be multiplied by
cuttings was forcibly impressed
upon our attention at a very early
age. When a boy, having seen a
most promising branch cut from a
favourite apple tree in the process
of pruning, the thought struck us
that we might get a tree of our
own, and so, seizing the branch in
question, we planted it in another
part of the garden, only&#8212;sad to
relate&#8212;to have it pulled up the
first time the gardener passed that
way. With a boy&#8217;s perseverance
or obstinacy&#8212;which the reader
pleases&#8212;again and again did we
replant this same branch with a like result, until
finding a quiet corner, we once more planted our
cutting, and this time, no evil chance overtaking
it, it took root; and in two years from that time we
enjoyed the taste of apples from what, we hope
not undeservedly, was allowed to be considered our
own tree. This was a matter for frequent reflection
in after-life, for, besides viewing the result as
a reward for perseverance, it is just possible that our
first disappointment may have tended after all to
our success, for doubtless the unexposed sheltered
corner was just the place for ensuring this in rooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
cuttings. Here, however, the cutting was a large
branch, but for general purposes we should recommend
cuttings to be made of small unbranched
shoots; these may be planted in rows in a somewhat
shaded situation, and when they have become rooted
and fit for independent trees, they may be removed
to their permanent places, and so be either pruned
for tall orchard trees, or, as they are well adapted to
the purpose, be trained for dwarf orchards.</p>

<p><i>Pruning</i>, in the cultivation and due keeping of an
orchard, is one of the most important operations
connected with the subject. Its objects are:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>1st. To circumscribe the growth in any given
direction, to train the tree on the one hand, and to
let in light and air by thinning on the other.</p>

<p>2nd. By pruning fruit trees we operate so as to
check undue growth of wood and leaf, and thus, by
what the botanist calls the &#8220;arrestation of development,&#8221;
cause flower and fruit to be formed instead
of leaves. In the western counties, if a tree or plant
of any kind grows leaves too freely, it is said to be
too &#8220;frum,&#8221; probably derived from the Saxon <i>from</i>,
strong, stout.</p>

<p>Pruning, then, hastens the fruiting season in fruit
trees, but at the same time it brings on premature
age, and hence the operation should be performed
with judgment, or else premature decay will be the
consequence. In pruning of large trees care should
be taken to cut out, as smoothly as possible, all
awkward or crossing branches, so as to expose the
whole of the fruiting limbs to light, warmth, and
air. This again is an operation requiring an experienced
hand, and when such an one is known, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
is far better to employ him than to trust the matter
to those who know little or nothing of the subject.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written upon the subject
of rearing fruit trees, and when matter of this kind
is addressed to the nurseryman, it is to be welcomed if
based upon sound botanical principles, but we cannot
recommend the farmer to grow his own fruit trees,
as he rarely pays sufficient attention to their youthful
training, and we therefore recommend the purchase
of fruit trees from the best growers, to get the best
sorts, and to get well-grown and healthy examples.
These should be carefully lifted and planted as soon as
possible after leaving the nursery, always avoiding
trees that have hawked the market week after week,
even if procurable for nothing.</p>

<p>Some people insist upon the propriety of planting
poor trees grown in poor soil, but our experience has
shown that nothing could be a greater mistake. It
is true that these often fruit soon; but getting crops
of fruit from trees only a quarter grown, though
sometimes welcome to a tenant with no sure holding,
is a matter which should always be looked to by the
landlord, who, indeed, should pay greater attention
to his orchards than is usually the case, if his desire
be to hand them down to his successors in anything
like a good bearing condition. That fruit trees must
in time get old is quite true; at the same time it may
be stated as an important fact, that poor stunted trees
on the one hand, or those too prodigal of their youth
on the other, will too surely result in decrepitude ere
half the span of a healthy tree be attained.</p>

<p>Feeling so strongly as we do the importance of
healthy young trees from a good soil and climate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
plant even in an unfavourable district, instead of, as is
generally sought after, trees from a poor soil, we are
glad to have our opinion fortified by a successful
practical grower of fruit trees, whose samples of young
stock in apple trees, as we have seen them exhibited
in Yeovil market, are patterns of healthiness in bark
and models of form. The cultivator to whom we
refer is Mr. J. Scott, whose name and place we have
before mentioned. He says, in his Descriptive Catalogue
of Fruit Trees:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>There remains <i>one thing</i> the writer would especially guard intending
planters against; that is, be careful <i>never to purchase</i> trees off a
poor soil. I know this is heterodox; but many years&#8217; experience has
taught me the fallacy of the popular dogma, <i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Get your trees off
poor soils, as they will be hardier, and endure the storms better.&#8221; I
could show examples, in numbers, in my nursery, where the trees
came from one of the so-called poor soils, that never will be anything
like healthy trees. They were hide-bound and checked in their
natures when I received them, and I believe will ever remain so, less
or more. A genial, moderately rich, and naturally good soil is the
soil I would choose my trees from.</p></blockquote>

<p>Experience and observation, both in the garden
and the orchard, fully confirm us in this view of the
case, and we would therefore only add to the direction,
&#8220;Get your trees from moderately rich soil,&#8221;
that of, &#8220;Plant them in a soil of the like kind;&#8221; for if
trees be brought from a poor soil, not fit for them, to
a poorer, they will certainly not succeed, and indeed
the choice of poor land for orchard growth will be
seen to end in disappointment.</p>

<p>In planting apples we should choose a mixture of
several of the best sorts, and it is recommended that
some should be sour; but we prefer to have those
that produce a juice of high specific gravity, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
with all cider and perry fruit there will be great
diversities in this respect, depending upon soil, climate,
and season.</p>

<p>The following list of apples contains such as are
met with principally in the counties of Worcester,
Hereford, and Gloucester; all may be used for cider,
but some are more especially adapted for house
purposes:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p>Pears for perry differ in one respect from apples,
in that, though the best and purest perry is made
from only one sort of fruit, and that generally from
fruit utterly unfit for any other purpose. Pears, as
has been stated, delight in a lighter soil than that
which is suitable for apples, and the trees have the
advantage of growing so tall that even cereal cultivation
is possible under them. It is, therefore,
curious to note how scarcely any perry pears are grown
in the west of England, unless we view Gloucester as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
a western county. Though Somerset and Dorset are
particularly adapted for the pear, there are many
places where its culture is never attempted; we would
mention the district of sandy loam around Sherborne,
Dorset, as one well adapted for the growth of perry,
but where it is nevertheless almost unknown.</p>

<p>It may be noted that although good cider&#8212;even
the best&#8212;can be made from dessert and culinary
fruit, yet dessert pears are not well adapted for perry,
as their produce is usually watery, and does not fine
well.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.</h3>

<h4>ON FRUIT-GATHERING, ETC.</h4>

<p>In making cider and perry there are several important
matters to be taken into consideration, as
upon the due observance of these success will mainly
depend. These are<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The selection, gathering, and storing of the fruit.<br />

The grinding of the fruit, and storage of the drink.<br />

The after-management, keeping, fining, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Orchard fruit is economized chiefly in the three
following methods:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>1. Cooking Apples&#8212;used for culinary purposes.<br />

2. Dessert Apples&#8212;some of the fine-flavoured varieties.<br />

3. Cider Fruit&#8212;which includes all the others.</p></blockquote>

<p>1. Cooking apples may be hand-picked as they
become ripe, and those that will not keep long, as
the various codlins, may be disposed of in the lump
to the fruiterer, or sent to market in smaller quantities.
The good keeping apples may be sold in the
lot when ripe, or kept in store to be retailed at
market.</p>

<p>Both these sets of apples require to be gathered
with some care; in short, to be what are called
&#8220;hand-picked,&#8221; as, when bruised, they not only are
injured for present use, but their keeping qualities
are greatly affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>For store apples the fruit should be gathered before
being what is called &#8220;dead ripe,&#8221; that is, when they
are quite crisp and juicy; one of the best indications
of fitness being a bright light-brown kernel as opposed
to a dull dark-brown.</p>

<p>The fruit should be kept in a dry room, from
which frost is entirely excluded, and where air can
freely ventilate whenever required. The best plan is
to fit up such a room with shelves made up of laths
three inches wide, and placed an inch and a half or
two inches apart.</p>

<div class="figc500"><a name="ShelvesFig" id="ShelvesFig"></a>
<p class="caption">PLAN OF SHELF FOR KEEPING FRUIT.</p>
<img src="images/illo369.png" alt="Shelves" width="500" height="84" />
</div>

<p>In this way <i><a href="#ShelvesFig">a</a></i> represents the laths, of which there
may be many or few to each shelf according to the
breadth required; <i><a href="#ShelvesFig">b</a></i>, the interspaces. Here, then,
the fruit is placed in lines over the interspaces, the
object being thus to secure a free passage for the air
all around the fruit; if placed in a single layer, faulty
ones can be seen at a glance, and these should be
removed as soon as detected.</p>

<p>If this plan be found too onerous, and fruit must
be put together in larger quantity, we would advise
that they be so placed as that air can get to them
from below. Keeping fruit in heaps in corners, or
even spreading them between layers of straw, tends
to their destruction rather than preservation. If,
then, it be borne in mind that the end to aim at,
in order to keep fruit, is that of exposing sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
examples to the free access of the air, it will be seen
that the nearer we can secure this the better will be
our result.</p>

<p>We say <i>sound</i> fruit, for it is useless to put
spotted and worm-eaten apples or pears in the
keeping-room. These had better be put by and used
as soon as possible for whatever purpose they may
be fit, for whenever the air can get into the interior
of fruit by reason of abrasions, borings, &amp;c., decay
soon sets in; and now, while we are writing, we have
a quantity of apples with the plague-spot of rottenness
proceeding from their being &#8220;worm-eaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. In storing dessert apples these directions are
even more important. If, then, the farm should
produce one or several sorts in quantity, if they are
to be disposed of, we would advise their sale to the
fruiterer with the onus of gathering and managing
them. Small farmers sometimes make no bad
addition to their income by thus disposing of fine
fruits, and we always advise that such should be
planted to a greater extent than is usually done
about farm homesteads. It is not a heavy matter
for the landlord to find a few sorts of choice fruit-trees
for his smaller or even larger holdings, and,
by thus adding to the comfort or even luxuries of his
tenants, he will be benefiting not only himself but
the country at large. We believe it to be a duty
incumbent upon the landed proprietor thus to foster
a love of fruits, and we honour the names of Knight,
of Downton, and Williams, of Pitmaston, in that they
loved to propagate new fruits, and to encourage their
dissemination. It is said by Mr. Benjamin Maund,
the author of &#8220;The Fruitist&#8221;:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>A propagator of apple and pear trees from seeds may be supposed
to possess not only patience, but a desire to benefit posterity. Twelve
or fourteen years cast a long shadow before them; and when, after
waiting this length of time, the uncertain value of the substance is
considered, it must be confessed that men deserve more than praise,
who originate new fruits. Apple trees rarely show the real quality
of their fruit in less than fourteen years. All, however, who have
the convenience of doing so, should raise seedling trees; for it is to
these only that we can look with any degree of confidence for
permanently furnishing our orchards, and not to old or cankering
varieties.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is true that it is not within the province of all,
even of the permanent owners of the soil, thus to
add to the number of Pomona&#8217;s gifts, but all can
inquire for and purchase esteemed sorts; and no
tenant that is worth having will grudge them care
and attention, be his tenure ever so precarious.</p>

<p>We would assign to the lords of the soil the duty
of improving fruit-trees, while the gentleman who
resides in the country, it may be for only a short
season, should make the best use of it to encourage
a love for the garden, and to increase its various
attractions to charm the eye, and to increase and
vary the vegetable food of the people.</p>

<p>3. Fruit for cider-making will consist of &#8220;wind-falls,&#8221;
that is, such as has fallen prematurely ripe,
or been shaken off by the wind; and gathered fruit.
As regards wind-falls, it is only necessary to state
that, although these can only be employed for an
inferior kind of drink, yet even this may be improved
by care, as thus:&#8212;Instead of picking up the apples
while they are still wet with dew, they should be
gathered in as dry a state as possible, and then not,
as is too often the case, huddled together in a heap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
in the orchard, exposed to alternations of frost, and
wet, and dry.</p>

<p>Such fruit will often require to be kept for some
time waiting temperate weather, which is best for
cider-making. It should be kept then under cover,
and in such a manner that the air can get beneath
it; and for this purpose we have found a few wattled
hurdles well adapted for keeping fruit on that is
waiting to be ground.</p>

<p>In gathering cider-fruit we should consider it ripe
at that period when a not rude shake of a limb
would cause most of it to fall pretty well at one and
the same time. We dislike beating off fruit with
sticks, as it damages the bearing shoots. In fine,
in gathering fruit all undue violence should be carefully
avoided, as it is unwise to use that amount of
hurry, which will only secure a large present crop,
unless it can be done in such a manner as not to
injure our hopes of the future. It is a curious
circumstance that in the garden there is usually
something like a crop, even in a bad season; but in
the orchard we seldom meet with anything like a
crop the year following what is called a &#8220;hit of
fruit,&#8221; and only the finer sorts of apples which are
hand-gathered with care are often found to be most
constant bearers, while the rougher cider-fruits seldom
afford a good crop oftener than once in from three
to five years. Surely, then, much of this must be
the result of the rougher treatment to which cider-fruit
is so carelessly subjected.</p>

<p>When the fruit is collected, it should be put in a
dry airy place, to await the process of grinding. For
this we adopt the plan of spreading it in sheds or outhouses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
on wattled hurdles. This keeps it from the
rain, by which it becomes sodden when in exposed
heaps: then the wind will only partially dry it, and
the result will be a general heating of the mass,
which results, if not in quick decay amounting to
absolute rottenness, yet in that state, technically
called &#8220;moisey,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or dead, in which the juices are
nearly dried up and the fruit flavourless.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Apple moise, or apple moce, was an old dish made of pressed
apples. In cider counties apples are called moisey when they are
juiceless, dry, and without flavour&#8212;dead. (See Archaic Dictionaries.)</p></div>

<p>We have seen heaps of apples, consisting of many
waggon-loads, in the orchard at Christmas, when wet
and frost had so preyed upon them that none of their
proper juices remained. This is certain to make a
cider which will be of inferior quality; and though
some of our friends boast of the good quality of their
cider which has been made in the roughest manner,
yet one cannot help thinking how much better it
might have been with the fruit carefully collected,
and kept until it could be ground. Still, with all
our care in this matter, disappointment is sometimes
the result; for it is with cider as with wine, the
season will have a great deal to do with it, though
with both, the manner of making and storing will be
all-important matters, to which we shall advert in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>We much object to the gathering of fruit for any
purpose in the wet. Were it not for the expense,
it would be better to take advantage of dry weather,
and to collect even cider-fruit by hand-picking before
it has become dead ripe, and so let the ripening process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
be completed in some dry storing-place. In our
own experience of cider-making, the two or three
casks made for home consumption from carefully
picked and well-kept fruit are usually of the best
quality, and so made we believe cider to be a most
agreeable and very wholesome beverage,&#8212;to paraphrase
Isaac Walton, only fit for farmers or very
honest men. As long, however, as rough people are
about who never know when they have had enough,
the rougher cider made by a ruder process is quite
good enough.</p>

<p>It must be obvious to all that if a man can drink
as much as four gallons of good cider in a day&#8217;s
mowing, he would be better off with a less quantity
of an inferior sort, supplemented with tea or coffee.</p>

<h4>ON CIDER-MAKING AND ITS MANAGEMENT.</h4>

<p>In making cider or perry it is well not to begin
unless the weather be moderately cool, as in hot
weather the changes in the fluid become too rapid,
and it consequently does not keep well.</p>

<p>The first process will be to grind the fruit into as
perfect a state of pulp as possible. This will be
effected when the kernels are decidedly crushed.
Such a state of pulp usually ensures the best results,
not only from the fact that the whole juice of the
fruit is not only set free, but it is all exposed to the
action of the air, by which both the colour and
quality are greatly improved; and, besides this,
every good quality is decidedly increased by having
the principles and flavour of the kernels mixed with
the other juices.</p>

<p>The method by which this is best effected is by
grinding in the usual circular stone horse-mill.
This is confessedly a slow process, but notwithstanding
the newer methods, to be presently described,
we still prefer it to all others, and that from
the great completeness with which the grinding is
effected.</p>

<p>Of late years cider-mills have been brought out
which essentially consist of a combination of gribbling
teeth, by which the fruit is first torn to pieces, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
two cylindrical rollers, between which it is afterwards
crushed with greater or less completeness.</p>

<p>In some cases the rollers are of iron, in others
of hard stone: the latter is preferable, as contact
with iron, even where but slight, causes the drink
to assume a degree of blackness, especially on
exposure.</p>

<p>Portable mills of this kind are now very general,
but we so fully agree with the remarks of Mr. Cadle,
that we here quote his description of some portable
cider-mills, with his comments upon their action.</p>

<blockquote class="small">

<p>About twenty-six years ago, Mr. Coleman, of Chaxhill, Westbury-on-Severn,
commenced making an improved cider-mill and press,
which could act either as a fixture or a portable mill. It was found
that the cider thus made fined better, and the process was also more
expeditious. These advantages, together with the cost of keeping
the old kind of mills in repair, which landlords were unwilling to
undertake, led to their being superseded, as they wore out, by
Coleman&#8217;s, or a similar mill.</p>

<p>Coleman&#8217;s mill consists of two pairs of rollers fixed in a strong
wooden frame; it is fed from a hopper, the apples passing through
the first pair of rollers, which are made of hard wood, with iron
teeth, so as to break the apples, which fall next between a pair of
stone rollers set close enough to break the kernels, and from these the
pulp drops into a trough placed beneath to receive it.</p>

<p>Mr. Latchem, of Hereford, has also paid considerable attention to
the construction of these mills, and has taken out a patent for doing
away with the iron in the feed-rollers, and substituting steel teeth
fitted into one roller, and working through other steel teeth on a
fixed plate, partly on the same principle as a curd-mill. The fruit,
after passing this &#8220;chewer,&#8221; is ground between a pair of stone rollers,
as before described.</p>

<p>Until the portable apple-mills became general, we had a mill to
almost every farm, and even to many of the cottages; but in Devonshire
one mill or pound-house serves for a number of makers, and
sometimes for a parish, each person paying so much per hogshead for
the making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum100"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Most of the travelling portable machines in Herefordshire have
two presses with each mill, and are worked by two horses, making
1,000 to 1,500 gallons in a day; sometimes they are worked by a
small portable steam-engine. They are very expeditious, and do
very well for a second-class cider, but if you would have the best,
they are very objectionable, because the different sorts of fruit very
rarely get ripe at once in sufficient quantities to enable you to make
much at a time. Much cider is therefore spoiled, the fruit being
ground when too green, by those who are impatient to finish the
process. I think that each farm or holding should have a mill of its
own, even if it be only a small hand-mill.</p>

<p>There are several other rude plans of grinding, such as nut-mills,
graters, scratchers, &amp;c., but they are so objectionable that they
hardly deserve notice.</p>

<p>All metallic substances should be kept from contact with the pulp,
as chemical combinations immediately take place on contact; for
instance, if you take a clean knife and cut an apple through, the
knife quickly becomes black, as well as the apple. For this reason
I think the iron teeth and cast-iron in the rollers are objectionable;
as also the steel ones, although perhaps not to the same extent. I
should recommend that this iron be removed, and fluted rollers of
larger diameter be made of some hard wood, such as yew-tree, or
American iron-wood. No doubt more power would then be required
to work the mills, but this would be of little consequence if the
produce was first-class cider.</p>

<p>When this new mode of grinding was first tried, there was great
complaint amongst the labourers that the cider did not agree with
them, and this was generally attributed to the iron; but in my
opinion, the green state of the fruit when ground made the juice
harsh, and caused irritation in the system.&#8212;<i>Journal R. A. S.</i>, vol.
<span class="allsmcaps">XXV.</span> page 1.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next point for consideration is the pressing
out of the juice. This has been done with screw-presses
of various kinds, either wood or iron, with
single or double screws.</p>

<p>Hydraulic presses are now coming into fashion, and
one advantage which they possess is, that of easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and expeditiously getting <i>all</i> the juice from the
pulp.</p>

<p>In Dorsetshire the ground pulp or &#8220;pummy&#8221; is
usually put upon a flat stage between layers of straw,
which are deftly turned up at the edges so as to keep
the &#8220;cheese&#8221; together. Upon the top of the cheese
is placed another flat board, which is acted upon by
the press.</p>

<p>In Worcestershire and Hereford the pulp is pressed
in hair cloths, which plan is much more perfect than
with straw.</p>

<p>In pressing it is well to observe that the pulp be
ground on one day and pressed the next, as not only
colour but general richness in quality results from
exposure. The dark colour which an apple assumes
on being cut is due to this cause, not as supposed to
the steel knife, for the change mentioned is equally
certain with a silver one. In the now almost exploded
plan of scooping apples, the pulp of even sour
apples becomes sweet by the process.</p>

<p>As the juice is exuded from the press it falls into
a trough beneath, which is divided into two parts
by a grating with small holes, by which the particles
of pulp are separated, and from this the clearer fluid
is conveyed to the cask.</p>

<p>As regards straining, we have seen some of the
finer sorts of perry made by a more complete straining
than the above; in fact, a rough kind of filtering
in flannel bags. This would take too long a time for
general purposes. It is, however, a good way of
making drink for bottling.</p>

<p>The after-management of cider and perry is a subject
upon which much has been both said and written.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
We, however, join in the country opinion, that
&#8220;if it be made well the less it is messed with the
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>We prefer putting cider in large casks in a cool
cellar&#8212;say of from one to two hundred gallons or more,&#8212;to
each of which should be two tap-holes, one in the
middle and one towards the bottom; the first tapping
from the middle hole insures a clear fluid without
disturbing the lower part, which thus goes on &#8220;settling
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>If cider from good fruit be made well, it will have
an agreeable sub-acid flavour, derived from the malic
acid, which is the principle which gives the refreshing
juice of most fruits.</p>

<p>Fermentation is necessary to make good cider, as
by it the sugar of the fruit is converted into alcohol
or spirit; and if, when this process is complete, the
fermentation ceases, we shall have a refreshing, exciting,
and generous fluid; if, however, it passes from
vinous to acetous fermentation, we get acetic acid,
and the product is sour.</p>

<p>Cider made from good and well-ordered fruit in
temperate weather, and put in casks in a cool cellar,
will be likely to ferment equably, and to stop at the
right time; if so, the product will be of the best; if,
however, these conditions have not been complied
with, the cider will be more or less harsh or &#8220;hard,&#8221;
and no means will avail to improve it. Sulphur may
be burnt in the casks to check fermentation; but
we would after all prefer acetic to sulphurous acid.
Chalk and lime will decompose the acid, but to little
purpose. The London method of adding sugar or
sugar-candy and water to sour cider&#8212;and to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
all mature cider is sour&#8212;is in itself innocent
enough.</p>

<p>There is, then, this consolation: if the cider be
harsh, farm labourers will drink it; and as they will
not, as a rule, drink half so much of the inferior as
of the best, they will after all be the gainers.</p>

<h4>ON THE USES AND ECONOMY OF CIDER AND PERRY.</h4>

<p>If we canvass the opinions of the mass of the people
in cider-producing and non-cider-producing counties
as to the relative merits of cider and beer, we shall
find opinions wider apart than even the counties
themselves. The &#8220;Beer-drinking Briton&#8221; cannot at
all understand how the lover of cider can skin his
throat with such sour stuff as cider, whilst the agricultural
labourer in cider districts infinitely prefers
harsh cider to the finest ale. We recollect, in one of
our geological trips in to Herefordshire, in company
with an esteemed clerical friend, that a quarryman,
working in Wenlock limestone, tendered us a few
shells, on which we offered him sixpence, remarking,
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a quart of beer for your trouble.&#8221; This
same man then gave our companion a couple of
trilobites, who presented him with a coin of like
value to our own, but with the remark, &#8220;Here, my
friend, is a <i>gallon of cider</i> for you.&#8221; The effect upon
the man&#8217;s whole being will never be forgotten. He
was the slave of the Church for the whole day, and
ever thereafter for all we can tell.</p>

<p>In cider districts the farmer, his family and friends,
all relish cider, and with all, its proper use seems to
agree in a most remarkable manner; but it would
be fun to a country cousin who could cease to look
at the matter in a serious light to see what a face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
his London relative would make at a draught of his
&#8220;own peculiar;&#8221; and yet he of the town professes to
like sweet cider; but as his knowledge of sweet cider
is obtained from the summer drink of the London
houses, called &#8220;Prime Devonshire Cider,&#8221; the following
recipe will explain it:<span class="nowrap">&#8212;</span></p>

ordinary cider racked into a clean cask, and well sulphured; but the
mass of that which is sent to London is mixed with water, treacle,
and alum, and then fined down, after which it is racked into well-matched
casks (<i>i.e.</i>, a burnt-sulphur match). The larger portion of
the cider sold in London, professing to be Devonshire cider, would be
rejected even by the farmers&#8217; servants in that county.</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder, then, that cider is not a favourite
beverage when it is only used as a summer drink
in some sophisticated form; but, when understood
and obtained at all good, we believe it to be wholesome
and palatable, and, indeed, we know it to
be preferred before even the best ales in cider
districts.</p>

<p>There is a common error amongst town-folk who
prefer the above mixture that cider is not intoxicating,
that it has no strength in it; but we regret
to say that it is not only intoxicating, but we
believe more exciting than beer: it is true that its
effects pass off sooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>Drunkenness with cider would seem to be so far
different than in the case of beer, in that while the
latter makes its victim heavy and stupid, the former
incites to motion, and leads to quarrelling, fighting,
and foolhardiness.</p>

<p>Hence, then, cider so exhilarates the farm labourer
that he will do any amount of work if he is constantly
plied with it, and all the while that it is
but stimulating him, he fancies he is getting
strength and vigour from it; but, alas! he is only
thus drawing upon his capital; exhaustion follows a
hard day&#8217;s work got over amid hard drinking, which
requires the following day to be spent on the same
high-pressure system, or else little will be done.
Hence one of our own labourers, during barley
mowing at so much <i>per acre</i>, was fain to confess
that he &#8220;wanted a pint of cider at four o&#8217;clock in
the morning worse nor any other time of day.&#8221;</p>

<p>It happens, then, that as harvest work is wanted
to be done expeditiously, it is let out by the piece,
by which the labourer gets more money and more
cider. But consider, my masters, that, when not
under these stimulants, you can only expect from
the workman a languid day&#8217;s work when the excitement
is over; and too often, indeed, the poor man
gets a long illness as the result of his forced, that is,
stimulated labour, and, if not, such a system of
drawing upon his capital&#8212;strength&#8212;is certain to end
in premature old age.</p>

<p>Seeing, however, that the labourer has got to believe
that drink keeps up his strength, it too often follows
that he concludes that the more he gets of it the
better; and hence, as a rule, there is no satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
him upon this head, and the result is, that the
labourer too often keeps himself in that state of
thirst and muzziness during his work that almost
compels him to seek the public-house when work is
done. Here quarrels ensue, and it is a wonder that
manslaughter is not more frequently the result.
Expelled from the scene of his debauch, he finds
his way home, unless, as is not unfrequent, he is
&#8220;found drowned&#8221; in the river by which he may have
to pass.</p>

<p>This is no fancied sketch, as it is derived from the
sad experience of the author and the result of events
in his own parish. On one melancholy occasion it
was indeed sad to hear the Coroner, among other
remarks, observe that full four-fifths of the inquests
in a cider county were the result of drink.</p>

<p>Is there not, then, a heavy responsibility resting
upon the farmer in especial connection with cider,
while his men are partially paid in this fluid? It
is different in the beer-drinking counties, as beer
costs more money, and is never allowed in such
quantity as cider. Put it down as true that the
farmer <i>at times</i> gets more work out of his men by
plying them with cider, yet we feel sure he thereby
hastens the time when such men can no longer
work, and they have then to be chargeable to the
parish, if in the mean time nothing worse should
happen.</p>

<p>Mechanics are not paid in drink; they purchase
what they require out of regular wages, and thus
they have the option, which many of them take
advantage of, of leaving off strong drink altogether;
and though they too are sometimes hard pressed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
get a piece of work done, yet, by over-hours, for
which they are rightly paid, not, as in the country,
wholly by cider, but in money, the business is
managed, and the workman can afford extra meat
and bread, by which his worn muscles are truly renovated,
and not merely stimulated to frantic action
as by drink. The great rise in the price of meat,
even before cattle disease became rife, is due to
the cause that so much more meat has, within
the last five years, been eaten by the British workman.
In this advance, however, the farm labourer
has had no part; he rarely gets meat twice a week,
while all this time his wages have advanced so much
as 25 <i>per cent.</i>, which rise, in nine cases out of ten, is
only looked upon as a boon, inasmuch as it enables
the recipient to &#8220;enjoy himself,&#8221; which simply means
he has more to spend at the public-house.</p>

<p>We conclude, as the result of experience, that
each sack of corn that finds its way to market from
a cider county costs 1s. (or 3d. per bushel) in drink,
which, though it is produced on the farm, might yet
have been sold to produce that amount.</p>

<p>Would it then not be better to sell such farm
produce, and, by giving extra money instead of
drink to the labourers, and so, by allowing him the
option of taking less drink but more meat, gradually
to withdraw him from the temptations to get drunk,
which beset him under the present system? For,
while we feel quite sure that the morbid craving for
the public-house has commenced with drinking on the
farm, we may be certain that if by any means we can
check this system, it will ultimately be a great gain
to both master and man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>Where are farm labourers best off? We say in
the non-cider counties. In these he has learnt the
use of skim-milk and the value of meat. In cider
counties the farm labourer despises skim-milk as
&#8220;poor weak tack, only fit for pigs.&#8221; He cannot get
meat, as he takes part of his wage in a stimulant
which excites him to spend some of his money in
falsely &#8220;<i>keeping up his strength</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now what are the results? We unhesitatingly
assert, muscle, longevity, more robust, honest, well-to-do
families, healthier bodies and minds, beyond
the cider limits.</p>

<p>If, then, these things be so, some change in the
use and economy of this wholesome drink is an object
worthy of the deepest and most earnest consideration.
One man alone can do no good. Beneficial results
can only follow upon calm discussion and combined
action by the masters, upon well ascertained facts.
We would not stint the labourer of that which is
to do him good; and if we find that he is really
willing and capable of taking the whole responsibility
connected with his drinking requirements
upon his own shoulders, we cannot help thinking
that it would be for the good of all parties to pay
increased wages in full rather than any portion in
kind, and more especially of the kind we have thus
animadverted upon.</p>

<hr class="c05" />

<p>In bringing these Papers to a conclusion, we would,
among other matters, make a few remarks upon the
title under which they have been issued, namely,
<i>Science and Practice of Farm Cultivation</i>.</p>

<p>Now it will be seen that our object has not been
to enter into the minuti&aelig; of practical farming, but
rather to point out some of the more important
scientific principles by which much of practice is
regulated. Hence, then, we would beg the reader
to amend the title as follows:&#8212;&#8220;Science <i>of</i> Practice
<i>in</i> Farm Cultivation.&#8221; This will more fully explain
the aim and object we have had in view in the series of
Papers now concluded.</p>

<p>It is now time to tender our best acknowledgements
for the aid we have received in the many
drawings with which this small work has been so
liberally illustrated. We owe especial thanks to Mr.
Hardwicke for several fine plates of interesting
agricultural as well as botanical specimens; to the
Royal Agricultural Society of England for the loan
of the woodcuts of roots; and to our friend Mr.
Wheeler, of Gloucester, for the use of the woodcut
illustrations of grasses; and as both the drawings
of roots and grasses were made by us direct on
the wood, rough though they may be, we yet hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
they may be deemed more faithful than any second-hand
copy.</p>

<p>Our labours being ended, it only remains to add
that we hope our little work may have the effect of
inducing some of our agricultural friends to look
into the principles connected with the various operations
which they daily superintend, as by so doing
agriculture will be really elevated to a science;
whereas, by merely copying what has been done
before, we shall only be empirics, practising rational
empiricism it is true, but still coming short of that
light and knowledge which is the life,&#8212;<i>the science</i>
of our profession.</p>
